    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>
      The Commission will examine which telecommunications services Canadians require to participate meaningfully in the digital economy and the Commission's role in ensuring the availability of affordable basic telecommunications services to all Canadians. The Commission intends to conduct this review in two phases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In phase 1, the Commission will review its policies regarding basic telecommunications services in Canada. The Commission will also gather information from the industry to better understand which telecommunications services are being offered across Canada and whether any areas in Canada are underserved or unserved.
    </p>
    <p>      
      The Commission invites interventions on the issues and questions identified in the notice. The deadline for filing these initial interventions is 30 June 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      In phase 2, which will be initiated in the fall of 2015, the Commission will ask Canadians to provide their opinions on the telecommunications services they consider necessary to participate meaningfully in the digital economy today and in the future. Specific details regarding the scope and procedure for this phase of the proceeding will be released at a later date.

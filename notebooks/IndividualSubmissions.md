Tell the CRTC: All Canadians Deserve Faster, Cheaper Internet Service

Big Telecom giants plan to keep you locked into some of the most expensive Internet services in the industrialized world.

They're trying to convince the government that Canadians are OK with their slow, costly services, and our huge digital divide. It's not fair: we deserve the same service as similar countries.

Time to set the record straight. In April 2016, a historic CRTC hearing will shape the future of Canada’s Internet. Join tens of thousands of Canadians and endorse our letter below NOW to demand affordable, world-class broadband Internet for all Canadians and we'll make sure your voice is heard

 `Dear Commissioners, Universal access in Canada must be defined to include affordable, world-class broadband Internet for 100% of the population. This access must have upload and download speeds and quality on par with our international counterparts.
 Canada’s goals are currently much slower than other industrialized countries. The U.S. recently defined broadband at 25 megabits per second down, and 3 megabits per seconds up. Our targets should be at least this ambitious.
 The CRTC should also prioritize new mechanisms for achieving these goals, including special opportunities for non-incumbent ISPs, municipalities, community access programs and non-profit service providers to deliver services to Canadians.
 A successful strategy will ensure that all Canadians have affordable, next-generation service. All telecom providers must provide this minimal level of connectivity everywhere they can at a reasonable price.
 I acknowledge that my comments and information will form part of the public record for this proceeding including on the CRTC website.
 I do not wish to appear at the hearing in relation to this submission.
 I ask that this submission be granted the same weight as that of any other party.
 Thank you`

##### Most negative/positive comments

`Negative OpenMedia`:

"It's crazy that canada lets it's Canadian citizens Suffer at the hands of big telecom!! All about greed greed and more greed!! "

`Positive OpenMedia`:

"Fast and affordable Internet, competing with the technology available in other countries, often for less than we pay for our sub par access, is important for Canadians bank accounts as well as for the Canadian economy as a whole. With more money in the bank, Canadians can contribute to the economy in other meaningful ways with their purchases, and with better technology Canada can better compete in global markets and be more resourceful here in the Canadian economy. It's a win for Canadians and a win for Canada, instead of just the big telecom companies winning by gouging us all, and Canada falling behind the rest of the world. "

`Positive ACORN`:

"It's important to also have fun in life! "

`Negative ACORN`:

"I would be able to afford a car and insurance for it gas without that money i can not afford to get married or own or insure a car for that ma er and that makes me very mad. "

`Positive HTML(not really positive)`

"I am using this as an opportunity to voice my opinion regarding internet in Nova Scotia- that being in rural areas. Several years back Eastlink \"won\" the contract in my area of N.S. ( Lunenburg County) to provide high speed internet. Previously having \"dial-up\" , this was a miracle. First of all they were at least a year over contract to have the job done and our government did nothing to obtain penalties from them. So, then we get it  ! So excited ! As it stands now , evenings and weekends, I am no better off than I was with dial-up. I have called and had my system checked out and told \"NO, that's as good as it gets\" . While I am thankful to have this wireless, the speeds are nowhere near what we were promised and nobody is checking into this. So Eastlink can brush us off and there are no consequences. We are supposed to be satisfied. Bell advertises Fibre-Op - what a joke that is. You have to live somewhere in town or close to town to get it. We are being shafted by corpor... <truncated>"

"I am a resident of Chaplin Saskatchewan and a vacationer at Palliser Regional Park on Lake Diefenbaker SK.  Our cellular service is absolutely terrible.  We farm 5 miles north of the #1 highway and our service is spotty at best.  North of us where we farm there is absolutely no cell service at all which makes it impossible for communications for breakdowns or any urgent problems or emergencies.At Palliser Park we have a seasonal site and there is not service where we camp there.  We bought a $600 booster so that we can at least be able to text but the tower there is too small to provide service once the park is at full capacity.  This not only causes problems at the park but it hinders all surrounding communities as far a Central Butte, SK.These concerns only encompass cellular coverage.  We also have absolutely terrible internet service.  Worse than the old dial up internet use to be.People in the cities pay a fee for service and have service!  We in the rural areas have to pay f... <truncated>

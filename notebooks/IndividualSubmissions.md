Tell the CRTC: All Canadians Deserve Faster, Cheaper Internet Service

Big Telecom giants plan to keep you locked into some of the most expensive Internet services in the industrialized world.

They're trying to convince the government that Canadians are OK with their slow, costly services, and our huge digital divide. It's not fair: we deserve the same service as similar countries.

Time to set the record straight. In April 2016, a historic CRTC hearing will shape the future of Canada’s Internet. Join tens of thousands of Canadians and endorse our letter below NOW to demand affordable, world-class broadband Internet for all Canadians and we'll make sure your voice is heard

 `Dear Commissioners, Universal access in Canada must be defined to include affordable, world-class broadband Internet for 100% of the population. This access must have upload and download speeds and quality on par with our international counterparts.
 Canada’s goals are currently much slower than other industrialized countries. The U.S. recently defined broadband at 25 megabits per second down, and 3 megabits per seconds up. Our targets should be at least this ambitious.
 The CRTC should also prioritize new mechanisms for achieving these goals, including special opportunities for non-incumbent ISPs, municipalities, community access programs and non-profit service providers to deliver services to Canadians.
 A successful strategy will ensure that all Canadians have affordable, next-generation service. All telecom providers must provide this minimal level of connectivity everywhere they can at a reasonable price.
 I acknowledge that my comments and information will form part of the public record for this proceeding including on the CRTC website.
 I do not wish to appear at the hearing in relation to this submission.
 I ask that this submission be granted the same weight as that of any other party.
 Thank you`

##### Most negative/positive comments

`Negative OpenMedia`:

"It's crazy that canada lets it's Canadian citizens Suffer at the hands of big telecom!! All about greed greed and more greed!! "

`Positive OpenMedia`:

"Fast and affordable Internet, competing with the technology available in other countries, often for less than we pay for our sub par access, is important for Canadians bank accounts as well as for the Canadian economy as a whole. With more money in the bank, Canadians can contribute to the economy in other meaningful ways with their purchases, and with better technology Canada can better compete in global markets and be more resourceful here in the Canadian economy. It's a win for Canadians and a win for Canada, instead of just the big telecom companies winning by gouging us all, and Canada falling behind the rest of the world. "

`Positive ACORN`:

"It's important to also have fun in life! "

`Negative ACORN`:

"The medical research I access is critically important as I have a health issue I must keep up to date on and my doctor sends me for the tests etc but does not have me to discuss in detail I want to keep up regarding the latest break- throughs and alternative therapies. I would feel more lost and worried without out more extensive information. Being able to email is very important as it keeps me connected to others and as I have this health issue right now it al- lows me to connectwhen I don't always have the energy to go out. "

`Positive Phase2`

" The basic service should include the medium speed internet service in my opinion and cover the whole territory. The customers benefit, the telecommunication companies benefit, the banks benefit, the merchants benefit, the health services, the Government the cities benefit and so on. The costs must therefore be borne by all those who benefit if we want a fair and equitable service.Mario Girard"

`Negative Phase2`

""I wish to comment on the regulation of broadband internet services in Canada, particularly the additional charges when customers go over their data usage caps. I am currently with an internet service provider whose best plan, which I have, costs $62.97 per month, and offers me 125GB of data traffic per month (downloading and uploading). If I use additional data, I am charged $3.00 per additional Gigabyte. That means that if I used an additional 125GB, I would be charged an additional $375.00. There is an alternative, which I have looked into, which is to have a second phone line installed, and set up an additional internet connection, to get another 125GB at $62.97. It seems absurd that in the one circumstance, I am paying $375.00 for an additional 125GB, while in the other, I am only paying an $62.97 for an additional 125GB. Why the company wants to put me through this is beyond comprehension. They will be supplying me with an additional modem (at their expense - it comes with th... <truncated>"

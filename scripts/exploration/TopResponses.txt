Yukon’s comments on the roles of stakeholder advisory groups in the following sections would also be applicable here. As the Chairman noted (Ts ) funding that is not focused on clear and specific purposes is like “pouring money into sand” May , of . Whether there is a National Broadband Strategy, or an action plan, or simply programs that are implemented within the context of current regulatory practice, Yukon submits that it is imperative to act. Canadians at the margins—whether geographic, economic or otherwise—will not be able to fully realize their potential in a digital society and economy without government intervention. Yukon and others can and will help, but the CRTC is the only appropriate agency able to provide the necessary leadership to make this happen. Basic Service . The concept of basic service is a regulatory construct, originally associated with the extension of telecommunications connectivity, to provide access throughout the country. As networks were extended, and telephone access became more ubiquitous, expectations for what should be part of basic service changed to include individual line service, direct dial access to long distance, and low-speed data connectivity. The approach to defining basic service adopted by the Commission, which Yukon submits remains relevant today, is a relative one.
In thoroughly reviewing the basic service obligation in Telecom Decision - the Commission began the definition of basic service in these words: “The Commission considers that the level of service now available to the vast majority of Canadians should be extended to as many Canadians as feasible in all regions of the country.” .

Policy guides industry. It can be used to preserve legacy technologies that are still essential. It can be used to foster investment and innovation that serve the evolving social and economic needs of the nation.
To this end, the outcome of this proceeding should be a policy that deters continued investment in legacy broadband technology such as DSL and foster investment in future proof technologies. Speed standard must be set to evolve to progressively replace technologies that have no future. Basic Service . There is agreement that the Internet is a Basic Service. However, the Commission must examine the meaning of “Internet”. As a Telecommunications regulator, the Commission does not regulate applications, does not decide that one application is essential while another one is not. It regulates access to a network.

Similarly, the imposition of industry-funded subsidies to end-users to address income-related concerns would be expensive, inefficient, and ineffective and would undermine potential industry programs.
Incorporation of the Issue of Affordability into a National Broadband Strategy In conclusion, TELUS recommends that affordability, along with the issue of adoption, be incorporated as core issues to be addressed as part of a National Broadband Strategy and that the elements outlined above by TELUS be incorporated into the framework for review of this particular issue. Submitted Electronically Jean-François Dumoulin Senior Coordinator of Programs and Partnerships, Tamaani Internet Administration Department Kativik Regional Government Tel. : -- May , Ms. Danielle May-Cuconato Secretary General Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Ottawa, ON KA N Re: Final Submission - Notice of Consultation - – Review of Basic Telecommunication Services, File number: -C- Dear Ms. May-Cuconato, . The Kativik Regional Government (KRG) is pleased to provide its final submission for the Review of Basic Telecommunication Services. Broadband as a basic service . The KRG maintains that broadband is an essential service and the information presented by the parties during the hearings reaffirm this position. The KRG is in the midst of implementing its Tamaani Internet Phase project, which is a five year plan to provide basic Internet connectivity to Nunavik over C- band satellite with consumer broadband plans of .Mbs/.Mbs for basic service and Mbs/.Mbs for premium service. Service obligation has essentially been imposed by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada under the Connecting Canadians program rules. We respectfully request that the Commission consider this project and avoid making a decision that would conflict with this obligation.

Therefore, we believe that the obligation to serve is necessary only locations where a single service provider, or no service provider, exists.  In the case of broadband services in areas where wireless ISPs are active, coverage of almost all subscribers is possible via the wireless network. In some cases where coverage is difficult, the customer has the choice to pay for better receiving facilities (for example, a tower for the receiving antenna); or to pay monthly fees for satellite service. In both cases, we believe that no obligation to serve is necessary. What is required to ensure that the customer has the best available Internet service, at the lowest monthly cost, are direct subsidies for the construction of the wireless network and access to optimum spectrum for the WISP; and subsidies to the customer for construction of improved receiving facilities in cases where they are necessary. What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services? CanWISP: Our members are of the opinion that broadband Internet service should not be defined as a basic telecommunications service.
Although we do believe that Internet service is essential for participation in modern-day economic and cultural life, our experience demonstrates that the private sector is motivated to supply service, and is able to supply service in virtually all instances, and it is not necessary for the CRTC to define it as a basic service and subsidize its operations. What resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory frameworks (e.g. CanWISP: The existing subsidy regime is founded on two principles: i.

The emergence of Video on demand applications in the recent years has proposed a unique challenge for small service providers. A few years ago it was a straightforward solution to providing basic telecommunications. There was sufficient wireless frequency to provide what consumers were demanding. With the exponential growth of Video on Demand, service providers are finding it more difficult to deliver what consumers demand. Video on Demand is saturating our networks and is eroding what we feel is basic telecommunications. But what is basic telecommunications? I’m sure in Nunavut the description would be different than in central Alberta. Regardless of what that is defined as, we know that the more internet access given, the more uses are found from that access.
Regardless of what basic telecommunications are defined as, Consumers are unhappy with their service if they cannot do what they want on the internet. In the past years, our prices have remained the same, but our service offering of speed and data have increased and fold.

Our Response Basic Services and an upgrade path to Broadband Services should be available to % of Canadians. Supporting infrastructure through direct government funding is the surest way to achieve such coverage and a basket of technologies will be most appropriate. The funding criteria should weigh in favor of technologies that will support Broadband Services for unserved and underserved Canadians in all regions of the country. www.oneweb.net b. What impact would the establishment of such a mechanism have on private sector investment and government programs to fund the provision of modern telecommunications services? What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services? Our Response Basic Services as defined above should be included in the definition of basic telecommunications services. The provision of dial tone voice will be less expensive when bundled with a basic Internet offering than providing voice services alone. What resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory frameworks (e.g.

The Commission also has jurisdiction to order either the upgrade or construction of new facilities based on subsections () and () of the Act. CNOC has provided more detailed submissions concerning questions of the Commission’s jurisdictional authority and correspondinglimits by way of the following responses to Commission issued requests for information (“RFIs”): CNOC(CRTC)Apr- and CNOC(CRTC)Apr- . . Structure of Submission . This final argument is structured as follows: • Part . of the submission characterizes broadband as an essential service and draws a distinction between the ‘needs’ and ‘wants’ of Canadians; • Part . makes recommendations with respect to speed targets and other service characteristics that should be reflected in the basic service objective; • Part . of the submission outlines CNOC’s views on how to develop and engage a national broadband strategy; • Part . sets out CNOC’s views as to how the national broadband strategy should be funded; • Part . addresses affordability concerns; Telecommunications Act, S.C. , c. . • Part . underlines the importance of prioritizing the most cost-effective telecommunications service platforms; • Part . proposes terms that must be associated with the subsidized provision of broadband Internet as a basic telecommunications service; • Part . includes CNOC’s recommendations relating to the existing local services framework; • Part . contains CNOC’s submissions with respect to special regulatory measures that are required in the serving territory of Northwestel Inc. (“Northwestel”); • Part . sets out proposed changes to the current contribution framework; • Part . addresses the need for discoverability of transport facilities and a review of the forbearance regime for inter-exchange transport; • Part . discusses digital literacy; and • Part . provides CNOC’s conclusions. . Broadband is a Basic Telecommunications Service . The record of the proceeding reflects a resounding consensus on the importance of broadband access to the daily lives of Canadians. Canadians have spoken and CNOC agrees that broadband access must therefore be considered a basic telecommunications service. Although the status of broadband as a basic service is now evident, the approach to defining the basic service objective is still somewhat unclear. In its first intervention, CNOC proposed a method of tiering different types of broadband applications or uses based on minimum supporting technical requirements. As the proceeding evolved, the focus has now shifted to distinguishing between the ‘needs’ and ‘wants’ of Canadians.

In these circumstances, it would not be efficient or proportionate to impose an obligation to serve on a given service or service provider where market forces can ensure the availability of competitive alternatives and practical substitutes. The Policy Direction requires the Commission to rely on market forces to the maximum extent feasible and to remove unnecessary regulation in competitive markets. This includes the elimination of the obligation to serve in all markets that have been forborne from regulation. Taking the foregoing into account, Shaw recommends the elimination of the obligation to serve in all markets where landline primary exchange service has been forborne from regulation. Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services? Please see our responses to Questions and above.
In addition, please note that simply because a service has been classified as a “basic” service or forms part of the basic service objective, does not mean that it should be subject to an obligation to serve or be subsidized using funds from the national contribution fund. These are separate issues that should be determined by other considerations, including most significantly whether the service is provided in a market where competitive or practical substitutes exist. What resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory frameworks (e.g.

And it is relied upon by many Manitobans and other Canadians to stay connected. Any removal of the wireline local telephone service basic service objective at this time will isolate many rural and remote Canadians. Approximately # of our wireline local telephone service customers are in rate bands which are eligible for the local service subsidy. As a result, any changes to the existing obligation to serve and the basic service objective will have a disproportionate and adverse impact on rural and remote customers across Manitoba and Canada. In particular, the cost of service will increase resulting in a critical service that is no longer affordable for, and consequently accessible by, many Canadians. Basic Telecommunications Services – Internet . With respect to basic access to the Internet, the ability to access affordable and reliable broadband services is of importance to Canadians.
In particular, speeds that allow consumers to access key public services such as emergency, health, education and financial services are necessary for Canadians to be able to participate meaningfully in today’s economy. [image: ]MTS Allstream submits that with TRP -, the Commission has already set the appropriate benchmark of Mbps download and Mbps upload speeds (:) to enable this. With such services Canadians would be able to actively participate online, use various government services, and achieve high-definition audio and video for education, health and entertainment.

The current basic service objective consists of: a) individual line local touch-tone service; b) capability to connect to the internet via low-speed data transmission at local rates; c) access to the long distance network, operator/directory assistance services, enhanced calling features and privacy protection features, emergency services, as well as voice message relay service; d) a printed copy of the current local telephone directory upon request; e) unlimited local calling at a flat monthly rate, subject to a price ceiling; and f) access to a choice of long distance service provider. Certain components listed seem somewhat archaic, such as the references to touch-tone service, dial-up internet access and access to alternate long distance service providers. However, wireline voice is a gradually declining service, there is no pressing need to make changes to the BSO at this time. Only wireline voice should be considered a basic telecommunications service. Broadband services should not be considered basic telecommunications and, if they were, should only be considered basic telecommunications at a level required to deliver everyday broadband services. No other services should be defined as basic telecommunications service. No changes are required at this time. The local subsidy regime is gradually going away, but continues to provide an important social safety net for a significant segment of society. The collection mechanism is a known, effective methodology for supporting this regime. In addition, the methodology is also used to calculate the Telecom Fees.

Having reviewed the reports of the National Broadband Task Force and Telecom Policy Review Panel, a National Broadband Strategy should be framed by key principles and we list these in Appendix to our remarks. And because a strategy needs leadership to get results, we propose a multi-stakeholder advisory council to oversee the strategy’s implementation. The council would bring together the many levels of government, industry, consumers and non-governmental organizations. The record of this proceeding has much to contribute on how to fulfill our proposed principles. We will expand on these aspects as we turn to our specific proposals in this proceeding. () Defining Broadband Internet as a Basic Service . Rogers agrees that the definition of basic telecom service should include broadband Internet.
Rogers recommends that the definition of basic telecom service should include a broadband Internet service that provides a connection of no less than Megabits per second download and Megabit per second upload. A broadband connection of and is sufficient to support the basic telecommunications requirements of Canadians. The most popular types of online activities, encompassing everything from emailing to watching high-def video, can be enjoyed using a basic and connection.

It is also possible to state with confidence that the design and implementation of such new or additional cross-subsidization measures would inevitably involve daunting challenges as well as a substantial regulatory burden on the Commission and industry participants. Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service objective? Cogeco submits that there is no compelling reason for changing or varying the obligation to serve and the basic service objective in non-forborne exchanges as determined in TRP -. Further, there is no need to apply additional ex ante regulatory requirements to all TSPs across the board for an obligation to serve or the extension of the basic service objective to a broadband Internet access service.

CBBC respectfully submits that that the Commission should try to develop a new regulatory framework, such as C-BIAN, that will foster and support a creative solution to addressing BIA service challenges through Canada.
If, and only to the extent that C-BIAN fails to support existing service providers, and attract new service providers, then CBBC submits that the ILEC BSO should be revised to require ILECs to provide modern telecommunications services in their operating territory where there is no evidence of resilient competition, where it does not appear that competition will become manifest and where incentive programs have failed to entice new service providers to begin providing modern telecommunications services. CBBC is also of the view that ILECs should be obligated to provide such modern services as part of the BSO in the following instances: () in all non-forborne exchanges; and () in those forborne exchanges where there are no alternate broadband service providers that are actually offering modern telecommunications services to at least % of the entire exchange on a sustainable basis. In the event that the ILEC is able to demonstrate to the Commission’s satisfaction that an alternate service provider is actually providing alternate modern telecommunications services to at least % of the entire exchange, the ILEC would then be at liberty to apply for service forbearance. - Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service?

However, if the Commission determines that there is a need for a subsidy, using a bidding mechanism, similar to the one already used by Industry Canada for the Connecting Canadians program, or a reverse auction, would minimize the size of the required subsidy. Furthermore, any subsidy should be funded out of general tax revenues, and, failing that, from a broad-based telecommunications charge. TELUS Communications Company TNC - July , First Intervention . Summary of TELUS Recommendations . The most significant action that the Commission can take is to maintain a robust commitment to facilities-based competition policies by limiting unbundling of networks. This will increase network availability and broadband adoption. Basic Telecommunications Services . TELUS recommends that a BTS be defined as follows:  A BTS is a service recognized to be of such critical importance to the economic and social welfare of Canadian citizens that universal access to such services at affordable rates is necessary for meaningful participation in the digital economy.
Based on this definition, the Commission should classify the following services as BTS:  Access to an individual local line with Touch-Tone service;  Access to the long distance network;  Access to operator services;  Access to a directory service;  Access to emergency services;  Access to privacy protection services;  Accessibility-related services for persons with disabilities; and  Access to broadband service at the / Mbps target speed. The Commission should no longer classify the following services as BTS:  Access to low-speed Internet at local rates (dial-up);  Choice of long distance Network (i.e., equal access); and  Requirement of an ILEC to make a copy of a local telephone directory available upon request.

• My estimate is that % of people don’t have access to high-speed internet • Need higher speed internet. (mentioned by different people) • It’s not high-speed. It’s basic service. • Most youth are familiar with the technology and yet they don’t have it. • Service is awful.

subsidies for low income individuals and households,[footnoteRef:] structural separation of backbone infrastructure,[footnoteRef:] and new funding mechanisms for lower levels of government[footnoteRef:]) is broad, there is a clear expression from numerous groups and individuals that broadband should be considered a basic telecommunication service, access should be universal, and the range of digital divides (access, affordability, skills/digital literacy) need to be addressed for the Canadian economy and society in general to thrive in the st century.

As is hopefully evident in our submission, SaskTel continues to believe that voice connections are more critical than broadband connections and thus dependability and reliability is more important with respect to voice service than with respect to broadband. SaskTel pointed out some of the potential concerns with using wireless service as a replacement for a truly critical wireline voice service in our comments of April in Telecom Notice of Consultation -, Proceeding to review access to basic telecommunications services and other matters when we stated: · Especially in rural areas, cellular service does not provide the same consistent, nearly ubiquitous, coverage as wireline local service. Cellular reception is best in the open air; degrades somewhat within vehicles; and is at its worst within buildings.

What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service objective?
Simply, Internet service of not less than megs download/ meg upload should be immediately included in the Basic Service Objective (with a scheduled review for upgrade in months); and that data links not less than megs should be available for public health and education institutions in areas where service is available, even if it is provided by a third-party; and that any telco that is subsidized be “Obligated” to provide the BSO service.

As discussed earlier, the Commission has forborne from regulation in the vast majority of telecommunications services markets in Canada APPENDIX A A- because these markets have been found to be subject to competition sufficient to protect the interests of users. In these circumstances, it would not be efficient or proportionate to impose an obligation to serve on a given service or service provider where market forces can ensure the availability of competitive alternatives and practical substitutes. The Policy Direction requires the Commission to rely on market forces to the maximum extent feasible and to remove unnecessary regulation in competitive markets. This includes the elimination of the obligation to serve in all markets that have been forborne from regulation. Taking the foregoing into account, Shaw recommends the elimination of the obligation to serve in all markets where landline primary exchange service has been forborne from regulation. Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services? Please see our responses to Questions and above.
In addition, please note that simply because a service has been classified as a “basic” service or forms part of the basic service objective, does not mean that it should be subject to an obligation to serve or be subsidized using funds from the national contribution fund. These are separate issues that should be determined by other considerations, including most significantly whether the service is provided in a market where competitive or practical substitutes exist.

CAD-ASC supports this ideal with the caveat that the word accessible is missing. The services may be affordable and they may be high-quality, but without accessibility they do not meet the objective of being available to all people in all regions. We note specifically that the Commission cites one of these services to be “low-speed data transmission at local rates”. “Low-speed” is insufficient for video transmissions; “data transmission” does not necessarily include video transmission; and “local rates” implies no discount or special rate packages for Deaf people. CAD-ASC recommends that the Commission revisit this particular element of its “basic service objective”. Broadband Internet service must be defined as a basic telecommunication service. We take this position not only on the need of Deaf Canadians to have the high-speed and high-quality service required for fluid video transmission but also on the reality that this is the direction the world is moving.
Work, entertainment, news, socializing, gaming, in fact every element of life in the st century is increasingly being conducted via the Internet, and consequently the need for broadband to handle all of this content has already become all-encompassing (and hence basic/essential) nowadays. CAD-ASC has frequently emphasized our position that any and all local service subsidy funds, such as the National Contribution Fund, can no longer be limited to only TSPs. (See our comments in the VRS proceedings passim.)

Brief answer: The BSO should be continued for voice but should now include broadband with a reasonable data allowance. The obligation to serve should be formally stated to be applicable to all Canadian carriers in their service territories along lines of supply (wireline) or within present range of transmission (wireless). The AAC has addressed this Consultation Question in the context of a broader treatment of the BSO in response to Consultation Question (b) and Consultation Question above. In sum, the next BSO should continue to include voice and also be upgraded to include “basic” broadband, as defined in relation to the - rule (when % of the population access the Internet via broadband and of those % at the specified speed) with a reasonable data allowance. The obligation to serve should be formally stated to be applicable to all Canadian carriers in their service territories along lines of supply (wireline) or within present range of transmission (wireless). What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services? Brief answer: There is no question that broadband Internet service should be defined as a “basic” telecommunications service, and that the BSO be upgraded to include access to broadband. Ongoing access to voice (wireless, wireline or VoIP) should also continue to be part of the definition of basic telecommunications services. As the AAC explained in response to Consultation Question (b) above, broadband Internet has become a critical service to fulfill Canadians’ social, economic and cultural needs today.
The Commission and individual Commissioners have previously stated their recognition of this fact, as has the Government of Canada in Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC - Phase Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition July Page of the Digital Canada strategy.

SaskTel then notes that “this is especially true in high cost service areas (HCSAs) where various satellite and wireless services cannot provide the same dependable quality of service as residential wireline connections” (para. ), and that “in the absence of the current Canadian contribution system the costs borne by rural and remote residents would rise substantially, especially in those cases where the copper infrastructure needs to be replaced” (para ). If “satellite and wireless services cannot provide the same dependable quality of service as residential wireline connections” with regard to legacy voice services, can the same not be said of broadband Internet services? In SaskTel’s view, what are the implications of this for residents and businesses in rural and remote communities who are served by satellite or wireless broadband services, but not by wireline broadband services?
C. In light of the increasing importance of broadband Internet services, please square SaskTel’s view that “in the absence of the current Canadian contribution system the costs borne by rural and remote residents [for wireline voice services] would rise substantially” with its later assertions that the Commission should not make changes to the Basic Service Objective or introduce a broadband subsidy plan (para ) and that broadband Internet service is not an essential (i.e. basic) service (para ). SaskTel(FMCC)Aug- SaskTel notes that “even in higher cost areas, average available speeds continue to advance and targeted government programs, such as BRAND and Connecting Canadians, are helping to spread these speeds to areas where this would otherwise not be economical” (para. ) and that “as a result SaskTel now has over rural communities with wireline broadband download speeds over Mbps […] the overall number of households without access to some type of broadband is already extremely low and is rapidly declining” (para.

The April hearing began with discussion of wants and needs. The Commission framed the hearing as one that was focused on defining basic telecommunications services, differentiating between what was essential (“the real and reasonable needs of the population”[footnoteRef:]) and what was not. Many intervenors have argued that the outcome of this consultation should be to address basic telecommunications services only, and indeed, this was the initial objective for the consultation. For these intervenors, this outcome would be realized by taking action on extending service to those who have no broadband access at present (achieving universal coverage). Some intervenors also made the case that the Commission can and should take action to address the affordability of broadband services, and others called for efforts to ensure digital inclusion and advance digital literacy. Review of Basic Telecommunications Services.
In his mid-hearing intervention Chairman Blais suggested that this proceeding “may very well be the last best chance to get it [a national broadband strategy] right.”[footnoteRef:] It is for this reason that I am arguing for a much broader framing of the central issues in this hearing, to be supported by the development of a national digital strategy. Consistent with this view point, I suggest that efforts to determine the essential characteristics of a broadband network should be informed by the broad vision of benefits that can be realized through deployment of digital technologies. Contrary to the idea of a basic level of telecommunications services (which is entrenched in the regulatory system), a broad vision for realizing benefits through the use of digital technologies calls for an ecosystem that enables innovation and experimentation, and supports advanced digital technologies. To the extent that it is possible, efforts should focus on building a digital ecosystem that is future proof, an argument made by multiple intervenors in submissions, during the hearing and in their final replies.

Xplornet has grown to become the largest rural Internet service provider in Canada by focusing exclusively on areas of Canada not served by wired solutions. Our customers are in every province and territory. While some live in the most remote locations of our country, most of our customers are just outside major urban cities. In this submission, Xplornet comments on the central issues raised in Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -, Review of Basic Telecommunications Services, and at the public proceeding convened by the Commission.
Regard should also be had to the Intervention filed by Xplornet on July , , and the supplementary intervention filed on February , , as well as the responses to the various rounds of interrogatories and the responses to undertakings filed on May , . BROADBAND INTERNET IS A BASIC SERVICE . Based on the legal definition and the passionate response of Canadians in these proceedings, there is little doubt that broadband Internet access has become a basic telecommunications service in Canada. It is used daily by more than % of Canadians to communicate with each other, with businesses, community organizations, schools, governments and other institutions. It enables business, banking, education, social interaction. It delivers the news and it entertains.

The approach described above would encourage the private sector to focus on areas where they can profitably delivery high quality service. In other areas, government R&D and deployments would reduce the costs to the point where they would be open to the private sector. Question : What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service objective? As described above, there should be an obligation to service and basic service objectives for all Canadian citizens. Question : Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? Broadband Internet is the basic telecommunication service. All other services will be subsumed as IP services over this network. of ! Question : What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service subsidy regime? Question : What changes, if any, should be made to the contribution collection mechanism?

Consequently, credible open access standards such as those detailed above are critical for balancing these contradictory incentives. Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services . It is the position of the writer that the CRTC mandate the delivery of equitable access to broadband Internet to all Canadians as part of the basic service objective. Open access is necessary to enable more applications and services competition. More competition will provide consumers with more choices, leading to better services and lower prices. Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? Fibre optic wireline and G/LTE wireless should be defined as basic service. Other access media such as fixed wireless, copper, coax, and satellite should not satisfy the definition of basic service and therefore not be eligible for funding. In other words, the public sector should only invest in next generation technologies and implement policies that encourage incumbent operators to decommission legacy network platforms.
The main issues related to reviewing the contribution/local subsidy regime in the context of including equitable access to broadband service as described above relate to the requirement for a regulatory regime that would complement the inclusion of access to fibre optic wireline and LTE wireless Internet service in an revised definition of basic service.

This would include the current obligation to provide standalone primary exchange service, which is a residual obligation to serve imposed on single class of provider in a competitive market. There should be no obligation to serve for any service provider providing broadband service.
Market circumstances offer no justification, under competition law or public utility principles, for the imposition of an obligation to serve in the context of a market served by a plurality of broadband platforms and providers An OTS cannot co-exist with the presence of pervasive retail HSIA by the Commission based on its conclusion that competition is sufficient to protect the interests of users. An OTS is an artifact of monopoly regulation that has no application to broadband services provided on a forborne basis. Section a(ii) of the Policy Direction to the CRTC states that Commission should “when relying upon regulation, use measures that are efficient and proportionate to their purpose and that interfere with the operation of competitive market forces to the minimum extent necessary to meet the policy objectives.” TELUS Communications Company TNC - July , Appendix C .

We suggest that initially, the basic service objective should apply in both regulated and forborne exchanges because: • high speed internet is a relatively new service • the current subscriber penetration of high speed internet service is not as high as for local service • service at the proposed target speeds is currently not even available in most Northern communities • except in Northwestel’s territory, Internet service is not regulated. In considering how the obligation to serve for this new component of the basic service objective should be imposed, the GNWT sees no need to modify the existing rules that apply to residential local service. Accordingly, the obligation to provide high speed Internet at the specified minimum speeds would be applied to ILECs in both regulated and forborne exchanges. Where rates are not regulated, prices would be subject to the maximum price ceiling we have tentatively suggested be set in the $ monthly range. We see no reason to apply the obligation to non- ILECs for the same reasons as in the case of residential local service. Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services? See responses to questions and . What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service subsidy regime?

The cost of leaving Canadians behind is too great not to begin to act immediately. In order to determine where these gaps exist, it is necessary to establish the substance of the basic service objective (BSO), or in other words, the minimum level of service or the basic telecommunications services required in all regions of Canada. Anywhere in Canada that does not CRTC, “Communications Monitoring Report, October”, , at p [CMR ]. Federal Communications Commission, “Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan”, p xi-xiv. Page of meet the BSO should be considered a gap in access to connectivity. What are “basic telecommunications services” in the basic service objective?
In determining which telecommunications services are contained within the BSO, it is important to keep in mind the CRTC's ongoing efforts around inclusion: Over the past several years, the CRTC has strengthened its efforts to place Canadians at the centre of the communications system, whether as consumers of communication products and services, creators and distributors of content, or citizens who need access to information to fully engage in a democratic society. Where the CRTC makes references to “Canadians”, it has already committed to include Canadians everywhere, in all regions, whether urban, rural or remote: The Commission notes that the primary goal of the obligation to serve and the basic service objective is for all Canadians, regardless of where they reside, to have reasonable access to basic telecommunications services. [emphasis added] . Given the essential and vital nature of broadband emphasized by intervenors in this proceeding and recognized by the CRTC, there should be no question that broadband must be included as a basic telecommunications service in the BSO. However, in order to determine where gaps in accessibility to broadband service exist, the BSO must include minimum standards of basic telecommunications services, including broadband.

We note that the government of the United Kingdom announced this past March that broadband would be made a basic legal right. The proposals would ensure broadband speeds of at least megabits per second, and include plans for a minimum broadband speed of megabits per second across the nation.

There will continue to be an increased demand and need for home internet service, along with wireless and data services that support the use of smart mobile devices. The CRTC plays a central role in ensuring that Canadians have greater access to these services in the years to come. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services . The Commission plays an important role in establishing regulatory measures to ensure that Canadians have proper access to basic telecommunications services. The basic service objective, in particular, provides the framework of services that incumbent local exchange carriers are obliged to provide to meet the basic needs of Canadians. Services that should be considered as basic communications services . The basic service objective outlines a suite of services that include basic local telephone, long distance, operator/directory assistance, emergency services, voice message relay, privacy protection and local telephone directory.
In its consultation (CRTC - ), the Commission concluded that broadband internet access services should not be included in the objective and that the deployment of these services should continue to rely on market forces and targeted government funding. As technology and the economy continue to evolve, so too do the telecommunications needs of Canadians. The fast changing landscape gives reason for regular review of regulatory measures like the basic service objective, especially if market forces aren’t filling the service gaps.

It is however possible to state with confidence that such new or additional mandated cross-subsidization measures for the benefit of the incumbent monopoly carrier in Northwestel’s operating territory would likely prevent mixed public and private competitive initiatives from taking hold or extending further. It is also possible to state with confidence that the design and implementation of such new or additional cross-subsidization measures would inevitably involve daunting challenges as well as a substantial regulatory burden on the Commission and industry participants. Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service objective? Cogeco submits that there is no compelling reason for changing or varying the obligation to serve and the basic service objective in non-forborne exchanges as determined in TRP -. Further, there is no need to apply additional ex ante regulatory requirements to all TSPs across the board for an obligation to serve or the extension of the basic service objective to a broadband Internet access service.

Rogers is also filing expert evidence prepared by Dr. Scott Wallsten, “Principles and Practices of Universal Service – Lessons from the United States,” included as Appendix .
Dr. Wallsten’s report reviews universal service policies and programs in the United States that sought to improve the availability and affordability of voice and Internet services, discusses their shortcomings and lessons for Canada. Dr. Wallsten is Senior Fellow and Vice President for Research with the Technology Policy Institute, and Senior Fellow with the Georgetown University Center for Business and Public Policy. Appendix to this submission provides results from a recent survey conducted by Ipsos, “Participation in the Digital Economy”. The results of the survey, which was conducted in October , include findings on the proportion of Canadians that do not access the Internet at home and key reasons for not subscribing. . Basic telecommunications service . Defining Basic Telecom Service . Rogers remains of the view that broadband Internet service is a basic telecom service that should be available to all Canadians. It provides a primary means for participation in the digital economy and society by providing users with a vast array of services and applications. It enables Canadians to communicate using tools such as voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), e-mail, and social networking. These forms of communication are both complements to, and substitutes for, traditional “Plain Old Telephone Service” (POTS) that is the cornerstone of the existing definition of basic telecommunications service.

However, having government health care and other services in the Northwestel operating territory, British Columbia can advise that enhancement to Northwestel’s service offerings would have a beneficial impact on the delivery of government services within that territory. British Columbia also notes that data communication costs in the Northwestel operating territory appear to be significantly higher than the data costs paid by government elsewhere in British Columbia.
Overall, British Columbia respectfully submits that a funding mechanism could have a positive and beneficial impact on citizens within British Columbia’s portion of the Northwestel operating territory as the introduction of modern telecommunications services could lead to improved citizen access to all government services; be they federal, provincial or municipal, including e-commerce, e-health outcomes and e-government services generally. - What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service objective? British Columbia respectfully submits that the BSO should be modified to have ILECs provide modern telecommunications services, including /Mbps Internet services, in regulated territories and in forborne territories for reasons previously expressed. - Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? For all of the reasons already expressed, British Columbia is of the view that /Mbps Internet service should replace dial-up services as part of the BSO. British Columbia also notes that the Commission has already ruled that wireless services can be used by incumbents as a substitute for primary exchange services. While British Columbia agrees with that approach, such wireless services should remain affordable to consumers. Should /Mbps Internet services be included into the BSO, British Columbia respectfully submits that the local subsidy regime might have to be revisited if operating revenues, after recovery of allowable capital expenses from the NCF, do not result in appropriate returns to the ILEC.

contribution burden related to expansion of broadband networks ultimately borne by Canadian telecommunications users, and ensure the maximum possible resources for investment and innovation. In addition, recipients of broadband funding should be required to participate in a competitive bidding process in order to ensure that the lowest cost service provider is selected. The funding process should also be technology agnostic. This will ensure that the widest range of networks and delivery technologies – including coaxial, fibre, hybrid, satellite, fixed wireless or mobile wireless networks – is eligible for subsidy, provided they meet the relevant service requirements. It will also ensure that the lowest cost, most efficient option is selected, while preserving technological and competitive neutrality. The Basic Service Objective . Several parties to the proceeding have recommended that the Basic Service Objective be modified to reflect the current telecommunications market. Shaw supports proposals to remove the obligation to provide Equal Access and a local telephone directory.
With regard to Equal Access, Shaw concurs with Bell’s position, which it described in its first intervention in the following terms: Given the changing competitive and technological environment for voice services, we recommend minor adjustments to the current BSO to eliminate the requirement to provide Equal Access and access to dial-up services. These services made sense in the old traditional (time-division multiplexing (TDM)) regime, but are no longer applicable in the new Internet Protocol (IP) world.

Unfortunately this accessible project wound down in . CUPW does not have a specific submission at this time but we have commissioned research into the viability of using this treasured public asset as a delivery mechanism for broadband, cell phone and other digital services.
While our research is ongoing, we feel that Canadians, and particularly rural Canadians, are underserved, and that the CRTC might want to consider ways that this huge national infrastructure could assist and improve the communication needs of our society. We would be pleased to share our research findings and recommendations with you once that ongoing work is completed and ask that you consider the reach of the national postal service when assessing the needs of Canadians in the area of communications. What do Canadians need from the telecommunications system? What are the basic services that Canadians require? Does this include broadband Internet? Is poor Internet service limiting your participation in the digital economy? Are there other barriers regarding telecommunications services that are hindering your ability to participate in the digital economy? Is the CRTC’s / Mbps* target sufficient for Canadians to participate in the digital economy?

[bookmark: _Toc]The BSO is a Universal Service Policy . The BSO is an expression of a universal service policy for basic telecommunications service in Canada. The BSO represents the types of telecommunications services, and service quality levels, that all citizens should be able to access. [footnoteRef:] Indeed this is the way the Commission itself characterizes the BSO. [: \tFirst Intervention of the AAC ( July ) at paras. What is the basic service objective? The Commission established the basic service objective in , which reflected the level of service available at that time to most Canadians. The basic service objective ensures that Canadians in all regions have access to affordable, high-quality telecommunications services.
Currently, the basic service objective consists of the following: - Individual line local touch-tone service; - Capability to connect to the Internet via low-speed data transmission at local rates; - Access to the long distance network, operator/directory assistance services, enhanced calling features - and privacy protection features, emergency services, as well as voice message relay service; and A printed copy of the current local telephone directory upon request.

FRPC generally reserves the right to comment on other parties’ submissions on this point. The price of basic telecommunications services must be based on affordability. The only data on the affordability of landline service is from , and shows that . thousand households did not have landline service because they could not afford it. Canada’s unusual characteristics – large country, small population – make it likely that regulatory intervention and support will be needed to ensure the affordability and availability of basic Internet services.
That said, when OECD members’ population densities in are compared with the price charged for megabit of data for broadband service in , Canada’s broadband price is roughly halfway between that of Iceland and Australia – the two other OECD members whose demography most resembles that of Canada. How access to basic service is ensured? Can market forces and government funding be relied on to ensure that all Canadians have access to basic telecommunications services?
What are the roles of the private sector and the various levels of government (federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal) in ensuring that investment in telecommunications infrastructure results in the availability of modern telecommunications services to all Canadians? Market forces cannot be relied on to ensure that the million people living in Canada have access to basic telecommunications services because such forces only operate properly when competition is unlimited. Locations where competition is even generally limited lack the market impetus required to discipline rate‐ setting and other behaviours.

In the current Proceeding the GNWT is recommending that the basic service objective be amended to include high speed Internet service with minimum speeds of Mbps download and Mbps upload, a minimum usage allowance of GB, and subject to an affordable price ceiling currently suggested to be in the area $.
We suggest that initially, the basic service objective should apply in both regulated and forborne exchanges because: • high speed internet is a relatively new service • the current subscriber penetration of high speed internet service is not as high as for local service • service at the proposed target speeds is currently not even available in most Northern communities • except in Northwestel’s territory, Internet service is not regulated. In considering how the obligation to serve for this new component of the basic service objective should be imposed, the GNWT sees no need to modify the existing rules that apply to residential local service. Accordingly, the obligation to provide high speed Internet at the specified minimum speeds would be applied to ILECs in both regulated and forborne exchanges. Where rates are not regulated, prices would be subject to the maximum price ceiling we have tentatively suggested be set in the $ monthly range. We see no reason to apply the obligation to non- ILECs for the same reasons as in the case of residential local service.

Finally in regard to new speed targets and timelines for such targets, the CRTC should carefully consider the recently adopted FCC broadband benchmarks speeds. In January of , the FCC revised its benchmark broadband speeds to Mbps download and Mbps upload. [footnoteRef:] The CRTC should consider revising its own download and upload speeds to match those recently adopted by the FCC. FCC Finds U.S. Broadband Deployment Not Keeping Pace. https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-A.pdf] . Broadband internet should be considered a basic telecommunication service. Broadband connectivity facilitates the broadest range of telecommunication services. Broadband can facilitate Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), Over the Top (OTT) telecommunication services and access to the internet.
As noted by the ITU, “high-speed, affordable broadband connectivity to the internet is a foundation stone of modern society.”[footnoteRef:] Furthermore the ITU notes that affordable broadband connectivity is essential to modern society. [footnoteRef:] Given that no other telecommunication service can provide as broad a range of uses, broadband must be considered a basic telecommunication service.

This longer period for business end-users may be required in light of the presence of long-term PIC contracts. However we expect that contracts for IXC services rarely exceed five years, thus allowing both customers and providers to exit and/or amend their arrangement before the sunset date. For business subscribers, we also propose a date of January to eliminate dial-around functionality. Long-term contract issues are irrelevant in the case of dial around.
Finally we note that Equal Access, or the separation of local and long-distance subscriptions, may of course continue past these sunset dates but on a forborne basis, as providers seek to satisfy the needs of their customer base. . Question Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? See our answers to Q, Q, Q and Q. . Question What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service subsidy regime? Recommendations Recommendation .: The costs used for the calculation of the local voice service subsidy amounts are inaccurate and the resultant subsidy amounts are overstated. Instead, the Commission should focus on the rate component of the calculations to reduce the local voice service subsidy requirement, as described in Recommendation ..

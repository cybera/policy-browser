Commission Chairman Blais has called for a coordinated approach to developing a national broadband strategy, recognizing the importance of multiple stakeholders and noting that the federal government has led successful strategy development in the past. As such, the comments provided here are directed to the federal government (through the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Navdeep Bains, and to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, Amarjeet Sohi) as well as to the Commission. [bookmark: NBP]A national broadband plan is not enough – advancing Canada’s Innovation Agenda requires a national digital strategy CRTC Chairman Blais observes that in Canada today broadband is “vital to economic, social, democratic and cultural successes of individuals and collectivities.”[footnoteRef:] I suggest it is a broader digital ecosystem – in which high quality digital content, services and technologies are universally available, affordable, and widely used to benefit individuals, communities and organizations  – that is now vital to success and will be fundamental to future efforts to foster innovation across the Canadian economy. Broadband is a just one component of this digital ecosystem, albeit an essential one. [:  Blais, J.-P. (). Statement: Review of Basic Telecommunications Services. http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/transcripts//tt.htm, paragraph .] To deliver on the federal government’s commitment to “build Canada as a centre of global innovation,”[footnoteRef:] Canada needs a national digital strategy, not just a stand-alone broadband strategy. Canada needs to articulate a clear vision as to how individuals, communities, not-for-profits, businesses and governments can take up digital technologies to enable and support innovation and extend social and economic benefits to all. It is this vision that should inform discussion of Canada’s digital infrastructure needs and provide the foundation for development of a future-focused broadband policy. Growing the Middle Class.

The April  hearing began with discussion of wants and needs. The Commission framed the hearing as one that was focused on defining basic telecommunications services, differentiating between what was essential (“the real and reasonable needs of the population”[footnoteRef:]) and what was not. Many intervenors have argued that the outcome of this consultation should be to address basic telecommunications services only, and indeed, this was the initial objective for the consultation. For these intervenors, this outcome would be realized by taking action on extending service to those who have no broadband access at present (achieving universal coverage). Some intervenors also made the case that the Commission can and should take action to address the affordability of broadband services, and others called for efforts to ensure digital inclusion and advance digital literacy. Review of Basic Telecommunications Services. In his mid-hearing intervention Chairman Blais suggested that this proceeding “may very well be the last best chance to get it [a national broadband strategy] right.”[footnoteRef:] It is for this reason that I am arguing for a much broader framing of the central issues in this hearing, to be supported by the development of a national digital strategy. Consistent with this view point, I suggest that efforts to determine the essential characteristics of a broadband network should be informed by the broad vision of benefits that can be realized through deployment of digital technologies. Contrary to the idea of a basic level of telecommunications services (which is entrenched in the regulatory system), a broad vision for realizing benefits through the use of digital technologies calls for an ecosystem that enables innovation and experimentation, and supports advanced digital technologies. To the extent that it is possible, efforts should focus on building a digital ecosystem that is future proof, an argument made by multiple intervenors in submissions, during the hearing and in their final replies. As other intervenors have suggested, the most future proof fixed line technology available today is fibre, with fibre to the home networks understood to offer the greatest potential for future capacity upgrades.

Commission Rules of Practice and Procedure, TELUS Communications Company   (“TELUS”) is filing with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications   Commission (“Commission”) this Second Intervention pursuant to paragraph  of   Review of basic telecommunications services, Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC   -, dated April , as amended by subsequent notices (TNC -” or the   “Notice”).      In this Second Intervention, TELUS takes the opportunity to briefly summarize the policy .  recommendations made in its First Intervention in July,  and to respond to various   proposals submitted by other parties that are contrary to the TELUS position. In its   rebuttal, TELUS applies the three policy pillars underpinning its overall proposal. These   are the Telecommunications Act,   the Policy Direction    and the TELUS public policy   principles. The application of the three policy pillars demonstrates that the   implementation of many of the alternative policy prescriptions put before the   Commission by other parties are unnecessary, would be potentially very expensive,   would be economically inefficient, are without precedent, and would be harmful to   consumers. The central issue in this proceeding is the definition of basic telecommunications services . While there is widespread agreement that broadband service should also be   considered a basic service along with voice and ancillary services and video relay service   (“VRS”), there is a wide disparity of views as to what exactly constitutes basic broadband   service, its availability and affordability, and if and in what form it should be subsidized. That the Commission’s current aspirational  Mbps download and  Mbps upload speed . (/ Mbps) target speed is sufficient for a basic telecommunications service is confirmed                                                        Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC --, Review of basic telecommunications services, June ,   , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC  -, December ,  and Telecom Notice of   Consultation CRTC --, January ,  [“TNC -”].

In Section , TELUS takes the opportunity to clarify the concepts of BTS, the basic .  service objective (“BSO”) and the obligation to serve (“OTS”) and how they should be   re-interpreted and applied in a revised and modernized regulatory framework going   forward. TELUS also elaborates on its Minimum Service Requirement (“MSR”)   proposal which would be a requirement for all providers of voice and ancillary services   but is unnecessary at this time for broadband services which should continue to be   available with minimally intrusive regulation. In section , TELUS rebuts proposals from other parties who argue for higher target .  speeds and for increased regulatory requirements for broadband service, including data   caps and various quality of service metrics. TELUS reiterates that the Commission’s   existing / Mbps target speed is sufficient for basic broadband service. In Section , TELUS rebuts various intervener arguments that mis-characterize the .  history of universal service and that would see the implementation of unnecessary new   rules and requirements for broadband expansion in the absence of any credible evidence   of the need to do so. Basic broadband at the / Mbps target speed will be available to all   or almost all Canadians by .

If government intervention is deemed   necessary, funding for either further broadband expansion, or to address income-related   concerns, is best sourced from general tax revenues.

    TELUS has also developed the TELUS public policy   principles as a third policy pillar to further assist the Commission. In its First   Intervention, TELUS applied these public policy principles to rigorously address the   issues raised in the Notice. For purposes of consistency and policy coherence, TELUS   applies these principles again in this Second Intervention in rebutting the positions of the   other parties. The TELUS public policy principles are provided in the table below.    See TELUS’ discussion of the Three Policy Pillars in its First Intervention of TELUS, TNC -, July   , , paras.     TNC -, para. , and Appendix B of TNC -, question  (Questions for discussion in this   proceeding). TELUS Communications Company TNC -   March ,  Second Intervention    REVISED         TELUS PUBLIC POLICY PRINCIPLES    Principle . Basic Telecommunications Service (BTS) Definition. A BTS is a service   recognized to be of such critical importance to the economic and social welfare of   Canadian citizens that universal access to such services at affordable rates is necessary   for “meaningful participation in the digital economy.”   Principle . The market is the default for the provision of BTS absent credible evidence   that market forces alone are incapable of achieving the BTS objectives for availability,   affordability and adoption. Responsibility for developing policies and programs governing BTS   availability and affordability objectives is shared by the Government and the CRTC in   order to (i) leverage relative institutional competencies; (ii) avoid unnecessary   duplication and inefficiency; and (iii) minimize inter-agency conflict and the risk of   contradictory regulation. Should financial assistance be necessary to achieve the BTS availability,    affordability and adoption objectives, the first-best (“most efficient”) approach requires   that it be (i) funded out of a broad-based charge on general revenues; (ii) structured to   minimize the degree to which consumer demand is altered by the imposition of the   charge; (iii) transparent in application and administration and (iv) targeted to achieve   maximum efficiency. Any test to calibrate the assistance necessary to address affordability   concerns should be “needs based” and evaluated with respect to the totality of household   expenditures required for a representative basket of basic goods and services rather than   on the basis of an individual service (e.g., BTS).

In this submission, and for the reasons explained                                                         See Intven (ed. ), Canadian Telecommunications Regulatory Handbook () at , citing Telecom   Regulatory Policy CRTC -, Obligation to serve and other matters, May , , para. See also Telecom Decision CRTC -, Telephone Service to High-Cost Serving Areas,   October , , para.  [“HCA Decision”].     See below, at section .., for a discussion of some dimensions of the obligation to serve, at common law.     In TNC -, para. , the Commission said that “The obligation to serve requires the ILECs to   provide telephone service to (i) existing customers, (ii) new customers requesting service where the ILECs   have facilities, and (iii) new customers requesting service beyond the limits of the ILECs’ facilities.” In a   footnote to (iii), the Commission added “The terms and conditions associated with such service extensions   are set out in the ILECs’ respective General Tariffs.”      TELUS Communications Company TNC -   March ,  Second Intervention    REVISED         below, TELUS proposes that the OTS remain in place in non-forborne exchanges   with regard to voice and ancillary services. TELUS is not proposing that an OTS   attach to broadband services in any area. . Charting the Course Forward    In a multiple supplier environment in which many customers are no longer served by . ILEC networks, it makes little sense to attach obligations such as the BSO exclusively to   ILECs. The effect of the application of such legacy regulatory concepts and thinking is   to deprive many Canadians of safeguards and protections that the Commission has   declared to be of singular importance.

Also see the First Intervention of   Dr. Catherine Middleton, TNC -, July , , para. TELUS Communications Company TNC -   March ,  Second Intervention    REVISED         Canadians to participate meaningfully in the digital economy. A number of the popular   Internet activities in which Canadians are engaged are most accurately characterized as   satisfying the recreational and entertainment wishes of Canadians. Activities such as   over the top (“OTT”) video and interactive gaming, as just two examples, should not be   considered part of a basic use of the Internet and, thus, the bandwidth necessary for these   activities should not define the minimum broadband speeds that are necessary for   Canadians to meaningfully participate in the digital economy.        Another claim of parties, that the Commission should not determine what constitutes an .  essential as opposed to a non-essential use of the Internet, is contrary to the Notice. This   proceeding is about determining which uses of the Internet are basic and what broadband   speed is required to support these basic uses. Canadians are not being told what they can   or cannot do on the Internet through this determination. It is about setting a minimum   speed standard so that Canadians can access these basic applications. .. The Current / Mbps Target Speed Is Sufficient for BTS    TELUS proposes a / Mbps broadband speed as a BTS. Some parties to this proceeding .  do not support maintaining the Commission’s current aspirational / Mbps target speed   for broadband and suggest that faster speeds are required. For example, a number of   parties suggest that  Mbps is an appropriate download speed. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 8d1bbffc892f64ca6ff0896563dad16078532eee0c7dc3950527ecd9297a808f
    Bell Act, s. , also imposes a statutory duty on Bell Canada to provide telephone service that is similar to   the common law obligation.     Minister of Justice for the Dominion of Canada v. City of Lévis [] A.C. .     Chastain v. British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority, [] B.C.J. TELUS Communications Company TNC -   March ,  Second Intervention    REVISED         position of “great and special advantage” such as the city derived from the fact that it was   the only convenient source of supply. This line of reasoning has been confirmed in more recent cases. For example, in . Commercial Alcohols Inc. v. Bruce Power, L.P., the Ontario Superior Court of Justice   ruled that Bruce Power did not have a monopoly over provision of steam energy and thus   that it did not have an obligation to serve further to Chastain.     Therefore, while an   ILEC could potentially be a public utility where it is a monopoly provider of a service   (for example, wireline telephone service in some remote areas), it will not be a public   utility where there is no monopoly. Critically, even if a company acts as a public utility with respect to some services in some .  areas, it will not necessarily be a public utility for other services in other areas; each of   the preconditions must be met in each case. Thus, in Perimeter Transportation Ltd. v.   Vancouver International Airport Authority the British Columbia Supreme Court stated   that:   Any duty owing by the public utility is in respect of that   commodity or service only, and the duty is owed only to those   seeking the commodity or service. As observed by the court in   Chastain at , the duty is "to supply its product to all who seek   it". OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 8d1bbffc892f64ca6ff0896563dad16078532eee0c7dc3950527ecd9297a808f
. Funding the National Broadband Strategy     . The AAC is critical of public – private / fund matching on the basis that such a subsidy   regime would inherently favour large service providers like Bell Canada and cut off subsidies from   independent or community service providers who might be best positioned to serve particular   communities. CNOC agrees that a strict / requirement could result in an undue advantage   for larger carriers in some situations. CNOC therefore recommends that a design feature of any   broadband program must be a degree of flexibility with respect to the public-private contribution   ratio necessary to deploy. Contribution flexibility should account for company size and other   factors (e.g. a First Nations or community focused provider). . Affordability    . Several carriers have expressed serious concerns with proposed requirements to offer rate   regulated “skinny basic broadband” packages as a means to address broadband affordability                                                                       Shaw final submission, at paras -.

The relevant unit in its proposal is the individual line and whether  the service provider that owns that line and is operating under an Obligation to Serve/Stand  Ready, is delivering the Commission’s mandated service levels for voice telephony and  broadband Internet access as part of the BSO. The relevant consideration is the subsidy  required to close the gap between a Commission established affordable rate for a service and  the Phase II cost of offering that service. If the service provider is delivering the BSO, then the  service provider would be entitled to subsidy funds relating to both voice and broadband  services for that line.

(B) Further to (A), indicate whether the circumstances would differ if the SILEC provides  the access facility outside of its operating territory? Why or why not? Answer   (A)(i)  The JTF’s position on wholesale regulation is found in its response to CRTC Question  f)  in the JTF’s initial intervention, dated  July , in this proceeding. The JTF notes that on   July  the Commission issued Review of wholesale wireline services and associated policies -  Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -. At paragraph  of the decision the CRTC stated as  follows:   The Commission does not consider it necessary or appropriate to extend the application  of the wholesale services framework beyond these entities at this time. In this regard,  the small incumbent local exchange carriers, as well as Northwestel Inc., were excluded  from the scope of this proceeding. However, we understand that a SILEC could be subject to any wholesale access obligations  deemed necessary by the Commission when providing a broadband access facility that receives  funding from a fund generated by a contribution charged applied to retail Internet service  revenues.

It does not  reflect the reality of consumers lived experiences in Canada today. It flies in the face of the  preponderance of evidence on the record. The Market has Failed First Nations  . Many parties have advocated that remaining gaps in service will be resolved by market forces  and targeted government funding. For MKO First Nations, however, this is a dream and not  the reality. In , one of the guiding principles arising from the National Broadband Task Force (NBTF) was that all Canadians should have access to the social, cultural and economic benefits  delivered through broadband applications. All communities, institutions, businesses and  individuals in Canada should have equitable and affordable access to broadband services, and to the widest possible range of content and service providers.  . In , the CRTC considered whether broadband should be included in the Basic Service  Objective. At that time, the CRTC decided market forces and targeted government funding  could cover broadband deployment. Target speeds of : were set with the expectation these  speeds would be available to all Canadians by the end of . Canadians have been waiting for over  years to have equitable and affordable access to  broadband services to allow them to fully enjoy their social, cultural and economic potential. For the past  years, specific target speeds have been mandated by the CRTC. Although  significant progress has been made in broadband connectivity, there remain over  million  Canadians who do not have access to these minimum target speeds and who cannot access the  benefits identified in and again in . An ad hoc response to market failures has led to  piecemeal access to essential telecommunications services in remote and rural communities.

It is expected that this would be the  case in other rural and remote areas where the absence of alternative options results in heavy  reliance on the Internet. “Skinny” Internet is not the right option for remote communities as the  Internet is often the primary service or only service for communications. If such a “skinny” price-regulated Internet package is implemented, it should only be one option available, among other affordable options for consumers who require higher capacity. To address affordability, a funding mechanism, such as the once proposed by the AAC and  supported in principle by MKO, would be more useful for MKO First Nations as long as unique characteristics of First Nations are taken into consideration (e.g. eligibility of bands who  provide community Wi-Fi). Target Speeds Within the Basic Service Objective   . Numerous parties have suggested that the CRTC should set specific target speeds for  broadband.

     I`ll let Jonathan discuss some of the market dynamics that impact our   members. JONATHAN Black      . Let’s start from what the Canadian consumers are saying. What follows are   comments taken from Canadians responses to the EKOS survey on rural   internet service commissioned by the CRTC for the benefit of this public   hearing. From all the good information about internet services we found, we   retained the following information pertaining specifically to the rural   market:      . First, Internet is the most used service of all the telecommunications   services. Just from this data, it is clear that Internet is an essential and   valuable service. Secondly, % of the  million internet subscribers are served by fixed   wireless, that’s   homes and businesses. Fixed wireless is, therefore,   an important method of delivering an internet service to consumers in rural   areas. And for good reasons: It’s not as expensive as laying out wirelines   and if it is setup correctly, in the right environment, it can be as reliable as   wireline-based services. Thirdly, there is higher dissatisfaction about internet access and services in   rural communities because of pricing and service level. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 8ce0263d82a19f5ce1f49ff8941057d59ef012449f330c045748ee1b12d3ee59
Fixed wireless is, therefore,   an important method of delivering an internet service to consumers in rural   areas. And for good reasons: It’s not as expensive as laying out wirelines   and if it is setup correctly, in the right environment, it can be as reliable as   wireline-based services. Thirdly, there is higher dissatisfaction about internet access and services in   rural communities because of pricing and service level. So let’s analyze each of these points and see how they link to our  main   topics. First point: Internet is an essential service. Where there is no internet   service, there should be. Since there are areas that still don’t have a reliable   service, we believe that capital expenditure funding assistance is both          necessary and required. And this funding should be made available on a   yearly basis. Funding should be available through competitive bidding, letting market   forces be the driver. However, many times we have seen public funding go to larger companies   which in turn in many cases used that money to overbuild existing networks   in rural areas. Above all, we consider that operational subsidies to telecom companies   should be abolished where there is already an alternative voice offering.

Response to Request  May  TekSavvy(CRTC)Mar-  TNC - Page  of  TekSavvy Solutions Inc. Response to Request  September  TekSavvy(Middleton)Aug- TNC - Page  of   Preamble In Paragraph  of your intervention you request “that the Commission continue to recognize the distinction between broadband access and the Internet service whose access it permits.” However, in Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC - and in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -, the Commission uses the term “broadband internet” to describe services that include “voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), email, text, and other data services” (CRTC -, paragraph ). In using the term “broadband internet” to describe these services the Commission does not appear to differentiate the provisioning of an internet service from the provisioning of the physical distribution network over which the service is delivered. Can you elaborate on your argument that calls for a distinction between broadband access and internet services permitted by broadband access? A.  Broadband access is the delivery of physical network access at the lowest layer of the telecommunications reference model at which it is practical to deliver it, in view of the context. Internet services are delivered over broadband access. There is no necessary identity between the provision of broadband access, and the delivery of Internet services over that access. Indeed, telecommunications services based on industry-standard reference models explicitly provide for the separation of these layers, which is the manner in which such services are combined. For instance, the delivery of Ethernet-based data connectivity is distinct from the provision of Internet access (or other services) over that connectivity. To the extent that the Commission and other parties use the term "broadband Internet", we understand this term to refer to a vertically-integrated model in which both broadband access and Internet services (including Internet access) are bundled together by the same provider. In TekSavvy's view, this vertical integration forecloses competition at the downstream services layer, and prevents consumers from accessing welfare-enhancing competition.

The Affordable Access Coalition or “AAC”[footnoteRef:] represents a range of interests from coast-to-coast, including low income Canadians and seniors. We are the largest public interest coalition participating in this proceeding. [:  	ACORN Canada (ACORN); Consumers’ Association of Canada (CAC); Council of Senior Citizens Organizations of British Columbia (COSCO); National Pensioners Federation (NPF); and Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC).] With me, from your left to your right, are:   · Herb John, President of the National Pensioners Federation;  · Judy Duncan, the National Head Organizer of ACORN Canada;  · Alysia Lau, Legal Counsel to PIAC;  · Geoff White, also Counsel to the Coalition;  · Edgardo Sepulveda, President of Sepulveda Consulting, and an expert on universal service regimes; and   · Cynthia Khoo, Student-at-Law at PIAC. The AAC is here today to help the Commission define “basic telecommunications service”. (i) Broadband internet access is a basic telecommunications service. Basic broadband today means at least  Mbps download and at least  Mbps upload;  (ii) However, many Canadians across the country still have no access or inadequate access, and many low-income Canadians are struggling to afford broadband and other basic telecommunications services. (iii) the AAC proposes two funding mechanisms to fix this: the Affordability Funding Mechanism and the Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism. These are capped, sustainable and workable solutions that will support reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality to all Canadians, and we believe Canadians would largely support such measures. Geoff ...  .	tHERE’S NO QUESTION: BROADBAND IS ESSENTIAL  [Geoffrey White]  . In , there is no question that home broadband access is essential.

In , for example, Canada Revenue Agency shut down its local inquiry and payment desks, and disallowed tax filing by telephone. And while Service Canada may have forms available to mail or pick-up in person, not all of their services are available at all locations. [Cynthia Khoo]  . When Canadians are connected, they communicate, share, collaborate, and create. They not only bolster the digital economy, they enrich the fabric of Canadian culture and society in a virtuous cycle of productivity, connection, and innovation. Broadband has become an essential telecommunications service, so all Canadians should have access to at least a “basic” level. BASIC BROADBAND DEFINED  [John Lawford]  . The next step is to define “basic” broadband. In its - decision the Commission did not define high-speed internet access as part of the basic service objective. Instead, it set a target of / Mbps, and hoped that those speeds would within four years be available to all Canadian homes, regardless of their geographic location, through a range of technologies. It hasn’t happened. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 9e184f9186da0c42455bb6c1db3be1be9e62653cc512ac58deec3d281a19ba32
Rather, the deployment fund is based on what I denote as the “Deployment USF Model” implemented and well-established elsewhere, which uses minimum subsidy auctions to subsidize new/incremental broadband in underserved and unserved areas. Both these new funds can be implemented relatively quickly and with reasonable administrative costs. The deployment fund is comparable in some respects to some traditional Government funding programs. The affordability fund is similar to the new $ million Ontario Electricity Support Program established in a little over a year to provide electricity subsidies to low-income households. .	conclusion  [Geoffrey White]  . Fast, affordable broadband access should be considered a basic telecommunications service. There are Canadians who are not connected to basic broadband and will not be connected in a reasonable time by market forces and government funding alone. Low-income Canadians are struggling when it comes to affording basic telecommunications services, including broadband. The AAC therefore encourages the Commission to adopt the two funding mechanisms it has proposed. They are costed, capped, sustainable and workable programs that will support access to basic telecommunications for all Canadians. PIAC’s national Environics survey indicated that the majority of Canadians would support financially contributing to such funds.

[bookmark: _Toc]The BSO is a Universal Service Policy  . The BSO is an expression of a universal service policy for basic telecommunications service in Canada. The BSO represents the types of telecommunications services, and service quality levels, that all citizens should be able to access. [footnoteRef:] Indeed this is the way the Commission itself characterizes the BSO. [:  	First Intervention of the AAC ( July ) at paras. What is the basic service objective? The Commission established the basic service objective in , which reflected the level of service available at that time to most Canadians. The basic service objective ensures that Canadians in all regions have access to affordable, high-quality telecommunications services. Currently, the basic service objective consists of the following:  - Individual line local touch-tone service; - Capability to connect to the Internet via low-speed data transmission at local rates; - Access to the long distance network, operator/directory assistance services, enhanced calling features - and privacy protection features, emergency services, as well as voice message relay service; and A printed copy of the current local telephone directory upon request. [footnoteRef:]  [:  	Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Communications Monitoring Report (), at page . ] Contrary to the positions of some intervenors, the Commission has consistently treated the BSO as a manifestation of a universal service obligation in Canada. In Telecom Decision CRTC -, for example, the Commission stated that “support for universal access at affordable rates and, to the extent possible, competitive equity must be maintained.”[footnoteRef:] [:  	Local Competition (Telecom Decision CRTC -) ( May ) at para. In Telecom Decision CRTC -, for example, the Commission stated   The Commission's challenge is to establish a reasonable level of service and to determine how, in a competitive era, all Canadians may gain access to that service.

[footnoteRef:] [:  	Ibid.] [bookmark: _Toc] Mbps Almost Meets the - Rule Today; Will Likely Achieve that Level Soon  . As noted above, the - rule states that a telecommunications service level is “basic”, for the purposes of determining universal service, if two conditions are met. [footnoteRef:] First, that at least % of all households at a national level subscribe to a service, such as broadband internet. Second, that % of those subscribed households in turn subscribe to a particular level of service, such as a given speed of broadband. Broadband internet access at this specific speed represents a basic service under the - rule. [footnoteRef:] [:  	“The Commission believes that, at this stage, Member States could be asked to consider including broadband connections in USO where the data rate in question is used at national level (i) by at least half of all households and (ii) by at least  % of all households with a broadband connection” [footnote omitted]. COM()  final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS on Universal service in e-communications: report on the outcome of the public consultation and the third periodic review of the scope in accordance with Article  of Directive //EC, online: <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:DC&from=EN> (“Commission Communication”), at .] [:  	See TNC CRTC -, Review of basic telecommunications services, First Intervention of the AAC ( July ), at paras -. ] According to data in the  Communications Monitoring Report (“CMR”),  Mbps downstream is close to becoming a basic service in Canada under the - Rule. Moreover,  Mbps may in fact be a basic service by the time the Commission renders its decision, given the length of this proceeding, the number of issues the Commission must make determinations on, the additional time before a decision is rendered and the pace at which technology evolves. The  CMR indicates that in , approximately % of households in Canada subscribed to broadband internet service at a speed of  Mbps or higher. [footnoteRef:] This means the first condition of the - rule is met, as at least % of households must subscribe to broadband (which the Commission considers to be . Mbps download and faster).

and may have regard to other considerations which are part of its wider mandate under s.  of the Telecommunications Act. The AAC contends that in a proceeding such as the instant one, the Commission, in setting wide policy goals and implementing that policy in part by determining rates and subsidies, should have strong regard for the above-noted telecommunications policy objectives as it pursues the public interest in basic telecommunications service. The AAC contends that the Commission must have regard, as directed by section , to, in particular, subsection (b) that rates be set allow carriers to “render reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas and in all regions of Canada.” [Emphasis added.] As noted, Bell has offered no evidence of the affordability of these proposed increases, either in Bell’s own territory or elsewhere. Bell’s proposed rate increases should therefore be rejected. The Essentiality of Broadband  . In its first intervention the AAC expressed its belief that there would not be much debate over the proposition that broadband has become an essential service, if not the essential telecommunications service, from the perspective of all Canadians. [footnoteRef:]  [:  	AAC, First Intervention ( July ) at para. As it turns out, most if not all interveners consider that broadband internet access is an essential telecom service. Noted academic researchers specializing in telecommunications policy, such as Catherine Middleton, Dwayne Winseck, and Tamara Shepherd have affirmed “the general assumption within much academic and policy literature that digital connectivity is essential for Canadians to be able to participate fully in contemporary civic and social life”. [footnoteRef:] Winseck lists effects such as individual and collective economic growth, access to education and information, social inclusion, enhanced civil rights and liberties, ameliorating inequality based on income and other grounds, and reliable emergency services as some of “the undoubted benefits of fast, affordable broadband access to the Internet”,[footnoteRef:] while Middleton states that “the essential enabler of telecommunications services delivery is a high quality broadband network”.

There should be no second-guessing of what users of telecommunications services are using, or why. However, if the Commission wishes to examine those uses, the AAC invites the Commission to consider the interventions filed by individual members of ACORN, or from the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, to get a sense of the vital importance of high-bandwidth connectivity. That a broadband connection may be used to “entertainment”, however that subjective term may be construed, does not diminish its importance. All Canadians from all regions, are to be included by means of telecommunications and broadcasting system, and therefore they cannot be excluded simply because the service provider considers that most of what it is selling to be non-essential. Because broadcasting is increasingly consumed via IP, as well, the Commission has to consider the impact on unserved and underserved Canadians of excluding them from the broadcasting system. To help support the provisioning of basic broadband service to all Canadians, the AAC has proposed a Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism which the Commission should adopt. The Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism would help service providers cover the uneconomic portion of their costs for deploying broadband to unserved and underserved Canadians. Regarding telecommunications affordability, the AAC has presented evidence that affordability is a major barrier for low-income Canadians. Lower-income Canadians have less access to essential telecommunications services, and, other than personal choice, affordability is the next major reason why Canadians do not subscribe to home internet service and wireless service. To help reduce this barrier the AAC has proposed an Affordability Funding Mechanism which the Commission should adopt. Both funding mechanisms would be capped annually, predictable, and stable, and they would be complementary to the operation of market forces and targeted government funding.

The CRTC *SERIOUSLY* dropped the ball on rural internet by concentrating solely on connection speeds and completely ignoring data caps. A rural user with a typical GB (gigabyte) monthly data cap and Mbps (megabit per second) download speed would start incurring (high) overage charges after only ~. hours of full-speed use. Put another way, this means that the rural user can only use their connection at full speed for about half of one percent of the billing month. ·  I, like many professionals, work from a home office.

In light of this accomplishment, Cogeco remains of the view that the Commission   should include, as proposed, the /Mbps broadband service in the basic service   objective and establish new target speeds of / Mbps to be available by . Accordingly, the areas where broadband service at / Mbps is not yet offered would   be defined as “unserved”, while the areas where no service under / Mbps is   offered would be identified as “underserved”. In so doing, the Commission would establish new benchmarks thereby guiding   private and government funding efforts to fill the gaps in unserved and underserved   areas. Under this proposed approach, the unserved areas would continue to be   identified as a national priority for  Internet network deployments while all new subsidy   awards would require making available to the residents of these areas a minimum   Internet service of / Mbps.

 A competitive bidding process should be used in order to award the lowest   subsidy needed for the building of broadband facilities, provided that the   proponent of a project is able to meet required standards and sustain the   service in the long term.  To the extent possible, such a program should not create reliance on this   funding for subsidized providers. In most cases, the subsidy should be a one-  time funding, not eligible for renewal, limited to a certain percentage of the total   costs of the proposed project. For very remote areas, namely the satellite-  dependent communities, recurring subsidies could be considered to cover a   portion of the operational costs.  In the case where funding would be allowed to transport facilities from location-  to-location enabling a TSP to upgrade an existing local network in order to   meet the basic broadband service objective in a given unserved area, and   even offer higher broadband speed packages, the owner of these subsidized   facilities should be required to provide wholesale access services to these   transport facilities.

SaskTel then notes that “this is especially true in high cost service areas (HCSAs) where various  satellite and wireless services cannot provide the same dependable quality of service as  residential wireline connections” (para. ), and that “in the absence of the current Canadian  contribution system the costs borne by rural and remote residents would rise substantially,  especially in those cases where the copper infrastructure needs to be replaced” (para ). If “satellite and wireless services cannot provide the same dependable quality of service  as residential wireline connections” with regard to legacy voice services, can the same  not be said of broadband Internet services?

SaskTel(FMCC)Aug-   SaskTel notes that “even in higher cost areas, average available speeds continue to advance  and targeted government programs, such as BRAND and Connecting Canadians, are helping to  spread these speeds to areas where this would otherwise not be economical” (para. ) and  that “as a result SaskTel now has over  rural communities with wireline broadband download  speeds over  Mbps […] the overall number of households without access to some type of  broadband is already extremely low and is rapidly declining” (para.

[Emphasis added]  Therefore, the provision of VRS should only be included in the BSO if the Commission needs to ensure that such a service is provided by ILECs, in regulated areas. These are not the conditions that align with the provision of VRS. As we highlighted above, VRS is to be provided by a central administrator, on a national basis. Accordingly, the BSO is not the appropriate vehicle for the Commission to ensure the provision of VRS across Canada. By declaring the provision of VRS as a basic telecommunications service, however – as the Commission has done – the Commission is able to ensure that VRS is provided on a national basis to all Canadians, consistent with the structure for the administration of the service as set out in TRP -. In short, VRS is a basic telecommunications service. However, we submit that the Commission need not, and should not, include the provision of VRS as part of the BSO. The function of the BSO is to articulate the obligations that ILEC's must meet in providing voice service in regulated areas. This function does not align with the provision of VRS, which is to be provided by a central administrator on a national basis. Accordingly, the provision of VRS is a basic telecommunications service that should remain separate and distinct from the BSO (and by extension ILEC obligations to provide the BSO). No specific action is needed to ensure access to VRS  Quite separate and apart from the provision of VRS is the question of access to VRS, which speaks to the availability of the underlying broadband networks that allow consumers to use the service.

ECN states that, were the BSO to include Internet and set at / delivery with an   affordable subsidy, it will meet the universal Basic Service specification. The subsidy,   that would be claimed by ECN, would be discounted in its pre-retail cost structure;   further, the retailer would be obliged to include a clear reference of the subsidy on the   customer invoice with a statement that a subsidy had been granted. The subsidy will   apply only to residential Basic Internet service. No portion of the affordable subsidies will be used for institutional or commercial clients:   At the moment, the major users of the ECN in the Cree communities are the Cree Health   Board, the Cree School Board, the Justice department, the local Councils and the   community radio services. Their bandwidth charges are based on shared real costs and   this principle will not change with the addition of consumer services. Any subsidy   accorded to consumer services will be for the benefit of consumers only and any overall   reduction in bandwidth costs because of increase volume usage will be calculated fairly;   the result of increased volume may very well be a lesser subsidy requirement; however   no portion of the subsidy will be passed on to institutional use.

We believe that all telecommunications service revenues (except the under-$-million   firms) should be subject to the telecommunications revenue-eligible fee for the subsidy   regime. Further by including all retail Internet as revenue-eligible, the fund would be increased   sufficiently to allow for new fibre-optic construction and development projects by   community telecoms. This additional allocation could be assigned to an independently-  managed national non-profit fund, licensed by the CRTC, for specific projects in remote   and northern regions; and the goal of this fund would be to help the local community   associations deliver Internet-based telecommunications services at fair rates. The fund   could also be increased and expanded to include ongoing provisioning costs to meet   increasing demand while maintaining price caps. The benefits that will accrue from these changes are similar to the telephone benefits   under the NCF; by providing a telephone subsidy, many telco networks have been able to   expand service to a growing number of communities, thus increasing telephone access;   similarly a subsidy available to community telecom providers, would increase the access   available to broadband services for underserved Canadians in outlying communities. Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications   services be subsidized? Explain, with supporting details, which services should be   subsidized and under what circumstances. As stated in Question , funds could be assigned to an independently-managed national   non-profit fund, licensed by the CRTC, for specific projects in remote and northern   regions; and the goal of this fund would be to help the local community associations   deliver Internet-based telecommunications services at fair rates. The fund could also be   increased and expanded to include ongoing provisioning costs to meet increasing demand   while maintaining price caps. The funds for remote non-profits should include telecommunications infrastructure   projects as well as provide for project-specific digital literacy and training activities   and/or projects focused on the development, provision and maintenance of   telecommunications services. This funding formula has been applied in the past by the   CRTC with regard to Community Radio where it has been an important factor in   developing Canadian content and talent.

The “information highway” is still a highway. CAD-ASC is very aware of the manner in which Canada’s northern territories lag behind the rest of the country in all respects of telecom services. It is not only Northwestel’s area that lags, but also Yukon’s infrastructure, which has limited that territory to only one or two broad-based service providers. In the case of the Deaf community, like the general population of the north, it is extremely widely scattered, isolated, insecure, and economically limited. We believe, therefore, that the Commission is correct in establishing a mechanism designed to support telecom services throughout the north, not only in Norwestel’s territory. Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications service:  . The Commission’s basic service objective is rooted in the ideal that all regions should have access to affordable, high-quality telecom services. CAD-ASC supports this ideal with the caveat that the word accessible is missing. The services may be affordable and they may be high-quality, but without accessibility they do not meet the objective of being available to all people in all regions. We note specifically that the Commission cites one of these services to be “low-speed data transmission at local rates”. “Low-speed” is insufficient for video transmissions; “data transmission” does not necessarily include video transmission; and “local rates” implies no discount or special rate packages for Deaf people.

We note specifically that the Commission cites one of these services to be “low-speed data transmission at local rates”. “Low-speed” is insufficient for video transmissions; “data transmission” does not necessarily include video transmission; and “local rates” implies no discount or special rate packages for Deaf people. CAD-ASC recommends that the Commission revisit this particular element of its “basic service objective”. Broadband Internet service must be defined as a basic telecommunication service. We take this position not only on the need of Deaf Canadians to have the high-speed and high-quality service required for fluid video transmission but also on the reality that this is the direction the world is moving. Work, entertainment, news, socializing, gaming, in fact every element of life in the st century is increasingly being conducted via the Internet, and consequently the need for broadband to handle all of this content has already become all-encompassing (and hence basic/essential) nowadays. CAD-ASC has frequently emphasized our position that any and all local service subsidy funds, such as the National Contribution Fund, can no longer be limited to only TSPs. (See our comments in the VRS proceedings passim.) It makes no sense to continue to restrict the requirement to contribute to such funds to merely the former monopoly telcos.

It makes no sense to continue to restrict the requirement to contribute to such funds to merely the former monopoly telcos. The telecom services being delivered today are not being delivered solely by those telcos, so why should they continue to be the only ones paying into the funds? CAD-ASC holds that every Internet service stakeholder (resellers, hardware services, cable and satellite providers, wireless service providers, etc.) should be required to contribute to the funds. Likewise, CAD-ASC is consistent in rejecting the $ million revenue minimum requirement for making contributions. There should be no minimum at all. We would accept classes of contribution based on revenues, by which those earning less than $ million/year would pay a lesser amount of contribution than those earning more than $ million/year. But there should be no exceptions in being required to pay some contribution. Moreover, all revenues should be included in calculating the amount to be paid. The provision of video transmissions will likely need subsidization; this has been established in the decisions regarding payment of the costs involved in creating and operating the Video Relay Service in Canada. CAD-ASC therefore supports the concept of subsidization for the implementation, delivery, and continuance of high-quality, high-speed video telecom services.

The lack of a national broadband plan has left Canada with no overall framework or  common set of goals to guide government initiatives. We endorse the CRTC’s proposal to  take up this challenge, and recognize the Commission’s unique expertise and its role under  the Telecommunications Act. Many OECD countries, including Canada, have already  agreed upon incorporating several areas of government policy in national broadband  policies (NBPs), as developed in the  Council Recommendation on Broadband and the   Declaration of the Seoul Ministerial for the Future of the Internet Economy.  Specifically, the OECD notes that NBPs link to policy areas including: crime and justice;  economy and finance; education and training; environment; health; industry; regional and  rural development; science, technology & innovation; and transport. In Canada, any NBP  will therefore necessarily have to involve the federal agencies responsible for these sectors,  and other key stakeholders.      																																																								  Note: we referred to these as “community intermediary organizations” in our earlier testimony, because of their origins and  strong connections to northern communities -- which include not only settlements but groups of Indigenous peoples. However,  the term “community” was confusing, and so we have included the term “regional” in this submission. National Broadband Plans. Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry Committee for Information, Computer  and Communications Policy, Working Party on Communication Infrastructures and Services Policy Report JT.  We note that the preparation of the U.S. national broadband plan led by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  included  public workshops,  public notices, and nine public hearings.

Connecting  America: The National Broadband Plan. Washington, DC, . The plan emphasizes the need for adoption as well as  infrastructure. FMCC – Final Comments  May ,      /	 	  . A National Broadband Strategy for Canada should be driven by partnerships that include the  regional community-based providers that FMCC refers to as intermediary organizations,  overseen by effective regulation, and guided by a multi-stakeholder advisory council that is  coordinated by the CRTC and involves representatives from Northern, Indigenous and  outlying areas of the country. Broadband for all    . Affordable and reliable broadband should be available to all Canadians, including those in   Indigenous and remote communities. We encourage the Commission to ensure that Indigenous and remote communities are  included in all requirements and implementation strategies for a national broadband policy. To this point, we note that in , the National Broadband Task Force report prioritized the  importance of connecting all First Nation, Inuit, rural and remote communities through  affordable access to services. As the report notes:      “The priority of the broadband deployment strategy should be to link all First Nation,  Inuit, rural and remote communities to national broadband networks using appropriate  technology. Further, access to broadband connectivity in First Nation, Inuit, rural and  remote communities should be available at a price reasonably comparable to that for  more densely populated areas” (p.).

FMCC Treasurer, Brian Beaton, was a member of that Task  Force in his role as the Coordinator of K-Net Services, Keewaytinook Okimakanak. As an  early draft of a National Broadband Strategy for Canada, that report made several points  specific to people living in Indigenous communities. Its guiding principles noted that:     “Our main order of business was to identify communities that are unlikely to obtain  broadband access as a result of market forces alone by , and to recommend  strategies involving collaborative action among all stakeholders to ensure that  businesses and residents in these communities have an opportunity to participate in,  and benefit from, the broadband revolution. To carry out this task, we found that we had to cast our net more widely and begin our  work by developing a shared vision and a common understanding of what broadband is  and why it is important for all Canadians, particularly for those living in First Nation, Inuit,  rural and remote Communities” (p.). The following sections of our submission refer to our specific positions on various issues   raised in the Basic Service Objective consultation (CRTC -). Broadband as a Basic Service    Basic Service Criteria    . During these hearings, we stated that the Basic Service definition should be expanded to   include broadband. In our interventions, research and public outreach activities, FMCC  members have documented and published more than  community stories and case  studies illustrating the effective use and development of innovative digital applications that  require broadband connections. People living in remote and Indigenous communities have  consistently demonstrated their rapid adoption and uptake of digital technologies by using all  bandwidth as soon as it becomes available. At the same time, bandwidth demands are  continually increasing due to the demands of new technologies and uses. For example, the  myriad devices associated with the “Internet of things” will only become more prevalent. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 8e6fa547343c31a60d1546e7eb408e51f85f2e45f1f9832c6f2869a97e9a185d
As MKO stated in its oral testimony:      “[S]ome individuals were waiting three months for a simple installation, or dealing with  service outages for six weeks at a time. That’s not six hours or six days, but six weeks. And during this kind of six-week delay, First Nation governments and businesses had to  return to manual processes and employees were not able to take the holidays that they  were otherwise entitled to” (MKO testimony, April , para ).  See: http://firstmile.ca/isumatv-builds-innovative-digital-infrastructure-to-share-high-def-streaming-video-in-remote- communities/    See: http://firstmile.ca/report-digital-technology-adoption-in-northern-and-remote-indigenous-communities-in-canada/      FMCC – Final Comments  May ,      /	 	    . We reiterate that any set of standards will necessarily be a “moving target,” and must   therefore be reviewed regularly, such as every three years. Community Requirements for Broadband    . We endorse the CRTC's efforts to look beyond household usage in its consideration of   Basic Services. We provided detailed evidence about the importance of Internet access and  broadband for Indigenous communities - not just individual households, but also local  services and organizations and businesses. We note that most models used to understand  digital technology adoption focus on individual and household adoption and ignore wider  social and community processes. But existing research literature suggests that there is a link  between the use of digital technologies in Indigenous communities, social capital, and  community economic development. For example, two recent studies – an FMCC study  completed for Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and a study  in rural southwest Alaska – highlight how broadband is used by Indigenous governments  and non-profit organizations as well as businesses including retail, fisheries, and tourism.     .

Basic Service must ensure that residents of rural and remote communities have  the same access to the essential public and commercial services available to urban  Canadians. We have noted that online access to these services is more important to rural  and remote community members because they lack the availability and range of ‘brick and  mortar’ or ‘offline’ services (healthcare, education, banking, retail, etc.) found in urban areas. A host of interveners from remote and Northern regions described how members of these  communities require sufficient capacity, speed, and low latency to provide and access  services including online banking, e-health, telemedicine, e-commerce, distance education,  e-justice, e-security, remote water and facility monitoring, and e-government.  See Hudson, Heather E. et al. “After Broadband. A Study of Organizational Use of Broadband in Southwest Alaska.”  Available at http://www.iser.uaa.alaska.edu/Publications/_-AfterBroadband.pdf      FMCC – Final Comments  May ,      /	 	      . In this context the FMCC recommends that the Commission ensure communities receive a   minimum amount of bandwidth to support local and regional infrastructure needs and  priorities. Through the “whole community” approach, local leaders and administrators can  engage in strategic planning regarding how bandwidth can be paid for, distributed and  managed in each community. This approach to bandwidth allocation enables local residents  to make decisions on how infrastructure and bandwidth is made available to deliver  essential services such as e-health, e-learning and so on. When Bell Canada was constructing the regional fibre network project to connect remote   First Nations across Northwestern Ontario, their business case included plans for GB of  bandwidth for each First Nation – with the understanding that the communities would  purchase additional bandwidth as required, when resources to do so became available. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 8e6fa547343c31a60d1546e7eb408e51f85f2e45f1f9832c6f2869a97e9a185d

The specific the level of bandwidth required in this approach must be determined based on  several variables including population and demand. However, FMCC recommends that  plans for every remote and rural community include a minimum of MB of bandwidth  capacity, with larger communities (over , people) provided a minimum GB of capacity. Affordability      . As NBDC pointed out: “The end goal of access is use” (Transcript April , para ). Affordability is a barrier to use across Canada - and especially in the North where incomes  are low and living expenses are high. Our primary focus in these hearings is on supporting  the long-term community and economic development opportunities of the Indigenous  residents of rural, remote and Northern communities. Residents and workers in these  regions – including entrepreneurs and professionals – should not be prevented from  providing business and services because of high-cost broadband or low data caps. We reject the comments by some industry representatives that ‘everything costs more in the  North’, and so high telecommunications prices should not be a policy concern.

For example, in terms of download speeds having multiple end users connected to a fixed access link degrades service quality, which is why EORN has increased download speeds of  Mbps to around % of the Region (see Part I of this intervention above). In terms of upload speeds, the  Mbps target speeds the Commission adopted in Telecommunications Regulatory Policy - remains significantly below the . Mbps symmetric connectivity speeds recommended by the National Broadband Task Force (NBTF) in . In terms of international competitiveness, the Commissions’ current upload and download target speeds continue to be substantially lower than those adopted in other high income countries, including U.S., the EU, and various countries in Asia. By adopting more ambitious service quality targets in this proceeding, the Commission could play a more active role in leading market expectations and motivating private providers to better meet the evolving telecommunications needs of Canadians. Such a federal regulatory strategy would support efforts by lower levels of government responsible for delivering social and economic infrastructure that ensures Canada develops a world class digital infrastructure. The Commissions’ role regarding access to basic telecommunications services  . Regulatory classification of broadband/high-speed connectivity: As a matter of fact, the convergence of traditional telecommunications and broadcasting to IP enabled networks has made access to reliable and affordable Internet connectivity of a high quality/speed the most basic telecommunications service Canadians require. As documented in Table  above, consultations in Eastern Ontario clearly indicate that broadband/high-speed connectivity is an essential element of the social and business infrastructure our stakeholders expect EOWC to prioritize and deliver. Recognizing this reality in the federal regulatory framework would help align the interests of federal policymakers with citizens, businesses, and the broader public sector trying to utilize a wide range of current and emerging over-the-top applications. The digital divide: How the Commission chooses to define basic service standards in this proceeding may not matter that much for the % of Canadians living and working in urban settings where competition is feasible and incentives of private operators to invest in network capacity/quality might appear sufficient to the Commission. However, in rural Canada it is often imperative for lower level governments to take the lead in promoting private sector incentives to deliver access and transport facilities required for public sector consumption, residential access, and to retain/attract business, jobs, and visitors.

As in British Columbia, we have done so by providing strategic inducements to the incumbent to deploy new transport facilities, upgrade its capabilities, and open its local POPs to other providers willing to serve communities across the Region. Although this approach may not be appropriate everywhere, it has helped increase both investment and competition in Eastern Ontario (i.e. lower prices/higher service quality). For example, under certain conditions it might be economically efficient to build duplicate transport infrastructure that competes with that of the incumbent (e.g. if coverage and capacity of the existing network are limited, the operator does not commit to investments in under-served communities or to interconnect with third party access providers who are willing to invest in small and remote communities at a reasonable price, etc.). Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services  . Changes to basic services obligations/objectives: Based on our mandate to advocate for the interests of citizens and other stakeholders in Eastern Ontario, as well as the evidence detailed above, the EOWC submits the Commission should incorporate broadband/high-speed Internet access services as part of the federal basic services framework. This reclassification would help align the federal regulatory framework with technological and economic reality created by the convergence of voice, video, broadcasting, and demand for relatively more network intensive nd generation personal and business Internet applications. With such a mandate the Commission would support efforts by lower levels of government to enhance private sector incentives to serve Canadians in under-served rural communities to participate fully in the digital economy. Minimizing the costs of basic services standards/obligations: In imposing such an obligation and funding its implementation, it is imperative that the Commission considers the drawbacks of returning to particularly inefficient elements of the traditional cross-subsidy model for providing universal telephone access before the rise of the Internet. Obliging incumbent operators to extend access in high cost areas to specific service standards the Commission deems appropriate might create incentives to erect additional regulatory protections against competition and entry, which will have compensating negative implications in terms of consumer welfare in both urban and rural Canada.

At the time this submission was prepared and approved by EOWC, a decision in the matter of wholesale access services by the CRTC had not been issued. Design of Canada’s wholesale access obligations to access and transport facilities are of critical importance of the ability of local communities to address market failures in rural areas such as Eastern Ontario. � Preamble to the CRTC - Notice of Hearing. � Rajabiun, R., & Middleton, C.

For example, a  Mbps connection can deliver a high-definition video stream (i.e. We are not in favour of increasing the criteria of broadband beyond  Mbps at this time, as the majority of rural service providers are just now reaching these targets. The Digital Canada  Program is injecting $ Million to increase speed availability to this level. As described in our response to .e) above, we foresee that bandwidth demands will increase during the next  to  years. We encourage the Commission to revisit this target in  years to determine whether this remains an appropriate service level for full participation in the evolving digital economy. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services   . Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital economy? In order to meaningfully participate in the digital economy, Canadian residents and businesses require reliable high-speed, low-latency connections that support two-way voice, video, VPN connectivity, and large file transfers. These characteristics enable both interpersonal communications and the use of cloud-based services that are crucial to many businesses. In addition to basic voice service, then, Internet connectivity at a speed of  Mbps downstream and  Mbps upstream should also be considered a basic telecommunications service. With a  Mbps /  Mbps connection speed, Canadians are able to set up businesses, tele-commute, access government services, communicate with customers, and remain connected to friends and family. . a)	Explain whether the underlying technology (e.g. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 0884b38526ccdf089a52ddc92649d3b5f7a091cc06631a9b4960de0a3903e51d
Satellite today provides adequate voice service for emergency purposes. Any broadband services defined as basic services should deliver reliable connectivity and consistent speeds. Minimum sustained throughput levels should be available a high percentage of the time, to permit the end users to depend on these services. Further, any broadband services defined as basic services should meet certain minimum standards of availability. The availability of broadband services is important to maintaining business continuity (for example through the availability of point-of-sale terminals), and is important for Canadians to meet deadlines such as those associated with government services. . c)	What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these prices be determined? We believe that mandated price setting is appropriate only in the scenario where an ongoing subsidy is delivered to the service provider. The BCBA does not advocate any ongoing subsidy mechanism associated with the provision of broadband connectivity services. Therefore, we do not believe the Commission should consider price setting at this time. In the BCBA members’ rural operating areas, competition has resulted in lower prices that are approaching urban prices in some markets. As more competition has been introduced to rural markets and technology has improved, the price for monthly service has fallen and continues to become more and more competitive without the introduction of price regulation.

Government-sponsored funding programs that offset capital expenses have brought connectivity to many households in these areas. Local governments have been instrumental in directing funding and ensuring that government funding is effectively deployed. The Digital Canada  program will result in the deployment of  Mbps services to thousands of rural and remote communities across Canada. The continuation of directed-funding programs, administered by various levels of government, is the most effective way to bring connectivity to rural and remote Canadian households in a fiscally responsible manner. These programs have established good service levels for most rural Canadians without an ongoing operational subsidy. What should be the Commission’s role in ensuring the availability of basic telecommunications services to all Canadians? What action, if any, should the Commission take where Canadians do not have access to telecommunications services that are considered to be basic services? The Commission’s role in ensuring availability of services is to promote a healthy marketplace that supports a diversity of firms, to ensure that market forces produce the best result for Canadians. Many rural markets today are served by a mix of large national mobile carriers, small locally-based fixed wireless broadband carriers, and satellite carriers. A diversity of broadband service providers in the Canadian market as a whole is crucial to ensuring a flexible industry that delivers appropriate options and a variety of choices to Canadian consumers. A deferral account approach to broadband service will result in a less diverse telecommunications industry, and will result in one-size-fits-all approach to broadband delivery.

. b)	 What impact would the establishment of such a mechanism have on private sector investment and government programs to fund the provision of modern telecommunications services? Without government support for capital infrastructure, private enterprise will not deliver terrestrial services to isolated communities. With government support, we have seen private enterprise deliver innovative services to many remote communities, and this innovation and investment can be expected to arise in more isolated communities. The BCBA has seen throughout our serving areas that economic development receives a substantial boost with the introduction of broadband services in rural communities. All citizens benefit from an improvement in the accessibility of social services, and businesses are able to expand in new and innovative ways. Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services   . What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service objective? The BCBA contends that no changes should be made at this time to the obligation to serve and the basic service objective as it relates to voice services. Broadband Internet service is indeed a basic telecommunications service. However, broadband service should not be part of a deferral account mechanism such as that currently in place for voice services. Satellite connectivity, available throughout Canada, already provides a level of connectivity that satisfies basic criteria for broadband. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 0884b38526ccdf089a52ddc92649d3b5f7a091cc06631a9b4960de0a3903e51d
At that time, the impact of the Digital Canada  program will be more apparent. Further, we note that many Canadians are substituting mobile services for copper telephony services. In five years’ time, the extent of this change may result in the obsolescence of the existing local service subsidy regime. Your response should address, with supporting rationale, which TSPs should be required to contribute to the NCF, which revenues should be contribution-eligible and which revenues, if any, should be excluded from the calculation of contribution-eligible revenues. We recommend that no changes be made to the collection mechanism. Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications services be subsidized? Explain, with supporting details, which services should be subsidized and under what circumstances. The existing subsidy regime is still necessary to ensure the availability of voice services. Currently, basic voice service provides access to emergency response services for many rural Canadians. Broadband service should not be subsidized through the existing mechanism due to the damaging impact this will have on Canada’s telecommunications industry, and the potential for long-term reduction of rural Canadians’ service levels and choices. If there is a need to establish a new funding mechanism to support the provision of modern telecommunications services, describe how this mechanism would operate.

To this end, Shaw recommends that, as part of the National Broadband Strategy, the   Commission and Federal Government review the recommendations of the Telecom Policy   Review Panel as they relate to support structures, and consider what steps could be taken   to expand subsection () to regulate access by carriers to the support structures of all   support structure owners, including provincially-regulated electrical utilities, empowering the   CRTC to resolve disputes between telecom carriers and support structure owners on   matters of attachment charges and other terms and conditions of access. D. Empowering Canadians to Discover the Opportunity of   Broadband    . There are various dimensions of empowerment: the ability to understand and appreciate the   Internet (skill and digital literacy), the ability to afford Internet access, and, for Canadians   with disabilities, the ability to access it. We address each aspect in turn. Affordability    . The evidence is clear that Canada is a highly connected country, with the vast majority of   households subscribed to high-speed Internet access services. The penetration rates,   prevailing speeds, monthly data usage, and prices of Internet access services demonstrate   that, overall, Canadians have access to high-quality, fast and reliable Internet access   services at home.  These are the products of Canada’s vibrantly competitive broadband   Internet access markets, featuring fierce inter-platform rivalry among a wide variety of   service providers that has been fostered by Canada’s long-standing policy of promoting   facilities-based competition. The Commission’s wholesale policies have also been designed   to promote competition and customer choice and their associated benefits, such as lower   prices, increased supplier responsiveness and higher levels of product and service   innovation. In a recent Federal Cabinet decision, Minister Navdeep Bains affirmed the   Commission’s wholesale framework as “a proven regulatory tool for enabling retail   competition in the Internet service market.”      . However, some parties to this proceeding have suggested that service pricing nevertheless   acts as a barrier to broadband adoption for some Canadians.

As stated by the Commission in its  decision on the Basic Service Objective:  “The Commission's challenge is to establish a reasonable level of service and to determine how, in a competitive era, all Canadians may gain access to that service. To fulfil the requirements of the [Telecommunications] Act, the Commission must balance social policy objectives (for example, high quality, affordable service) with competitive ones (for example, minimizing subsidies). It must weigh the cost of any programs to improve service against the financial burden placed on those paying for these programs.”[footnoteRef:] [:  	Telecom Decision CRTC -, Telephone Service to High-Cost Serving Areas, October , paragraph ]   . In this submission MTS Allstream will address what it believes to be the “basic” services required by Canadians to adequately participate in the economy today, including the continuing importance of basic phone services. MTS Allstream will also discuss the state of broadband services in Canada today and whether it meets the basic needs of Canadians, and where it does not, MTS Allstream will discuss what it believes is the most appropriate role for the public sector, particularly the Commission, federal, provincial, territorial and local governments, and the private sector. Addressing the basic economic requirements of Canadians . At the core of TNC - is the question of what are the “basic” telecommunications services that all Canadians require to adequately participate in today’s economy – not what are the ideal telecommunications services, but what are the basic services that Canadians require. As defined by Canada’s Telecommunication Act (the Act), the Commission must strive to achieve “reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada”[footnoteRef:], and through the Act, the Commission is granted the powers to regulate – to “require any telecommunications service provider to contribute, subject to any conditions that the Commission may set, to a fund to support continuing access by Canadians to basic telecommunications services.”[footnoteRef:] [emphasis added]  [:  	Telecommunications Act, Section (b)]  [:  	Telecommunications Act, Section .()]   . As with the provision of many goods and services, we of course, ideally, want to achieve more: better roads, better access to water, better access to food or higher speed Internet in every community across Canada no matter how remote, but ultimately we know and understand there are costs to providing such services. Canada has a vast geography and its population can be very dispersed. In many of Canada’s rural and remote communities, distances and population density make such service provision challenging and costly.

Canada has a vast geography and its population can be very dispersed. In many of Canada’s rural and remote communities, distances and population density make such service provision challenging and costly. With limited resources public and private partnerships are essential. The key question becomes what is the highest level of basic service that we can reasonably achieve through such government and private sector involvement to ensure all Canadians can succeed in today’s digital economy? In the context of telecommunications, MTS Allstream takes the position that the most important telecommunications services required by Canadian consumers to meaningfully participate in today’s economy are those that can be defined as ) public services, services in which government has deemed important for all Canadians to have access to: emergency services,  health care services, education resources, government services such as ability to renew a driver’s licenses, passports, or the ability to access government programs; and ) other basic  services that enable Canadians to perform functions such as searching out and finding a job, filing taxes and accessing basic financial/banking services. Basic Telecommunications Services – Voice  . To access these services, MTS Allstream submits Canadians, particularly those in rural and remote regions of Canada, continue to require access to basic voice connectivity. Following the introduction of competition in local phone service in the s, in Telecom Decision CRTC -, Telephone Service to High Cost Serving Areas, the Commission established the first basic service objective: that the level of basic phone service available to the vast majority of Canadians should and must be extended to all Canadians in all regions of the country. While much debate occurred over the following years, the Commission has maintained this basic phone service objective to this day. As recently as Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -, The Obligation to Serve and other matters (TRP -), the Commission reaffirmed its belief that the obligation to serve and the basic service objective for basic phone services continue to be required. Despite technological changes and the expansion of wireless services, their presence was not found to be sufficiently ubiquitous and reliable in high-cost serving areas. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 8c7f42dd3a67a4cca69eba3fd4d2e8fdf97f0810d796ac035f5f91709a5ccf86
And it is relied upon by many Manitobans and other Canadians to stay connected. Any removal of the wireline local telephone service basic service objective at this time will isolate many rural and remote Canadians. Approximately # of our wireline local telephone service customers are in rate bands which are eligible for the local service subsidy. As a result, any changes to the existing obligation to serve and the basic service objective will have a disproportionate and adverse impact on rural and remote customers across Manitoba and Canada. In particular, the cost of service will increase resulting in a critical service that is no longer affordable for, and consequently accessible by, many Canadians. Basic Telecommunications Services – Internet  . With respect to basic access to the Internet, the ability to access affordable and reliable broadband services is of importance to Canadians. In particular, speeds that allow consumers to access key public services such as emergency, health, education and financial services are necessary for Canadians to be able to participate meaningfully in today’s economy. [image: ]MTS Allstream submits that with TRP -, the Commission has already set the appropriate benchmark of  Mbps download and  Mbps upload speeds (:) to enable this. With such services Canadians would be able to actively participate online, use various government services, and achieve high-definition audio and video for education, health and entertainment.

In regions with very low population densities where the costs to build fibre transport to rural and remote communities are at times prohibitive, government programs such as the federal Rural Broadband Fund, Connecting Canadians as well as federal/provincial/municipal infrastructure funds have been very successful in narrowing those small gaps in communities where the market has not been able to reach. (d)	MTS Allstream submits that most homes, even those in rural and remote areas, already have sufficient “access” connectivity by virtue of having a phone-line. Fixed wireless access can be established affordably and as we have mentioned in our submission, there is a large variety of technologies underlying basic broadband services such as wireline, fixed wireless and satellite. (e)	MTS Allstream believes that in the next  to  years, Canadians will still need access to reliable, high quality, voice services as currently mandated today as well as access to reliable and affordable basic broadband services in order to participate meaningfully in today’s digital economy. Our responses to parts a) through d) would see no change. The ability to access basic broadband services is important to Canadians. The Commission has set the target of : for Canadians to meaningful participate in Canada’s economy. Such speeds allow all Canadians to access key public services such as emergency, health, education and financial services. However, as discussed in MTS Allstream’s intervention maximum ADSL upload speeds may be slightly lower than the targeted upload speed of  Mbps, but MTS Allstream believes such speeds are sufficient for Canadians to fully participate in today’s digital economy.

(b) The current terms and conditions of basic telecommunications services in regards to voice should see no changes.

The few remaining households can be addressed by government/private sector partnerships. Further, MTS Allstream emphasizes the broadband market is fundamentally different than the traditional voice market. As discussed in its intervention, there is no clear or single telecommunications provider that can assume the obligation to serve. Moreover, unlike basic voice services, the technologies underlying basic broadband services are also diverse and continually evolving – creating a dynamism that will be difficult to regulate effectively. (c) The market will set the price in most instances, which will generally incorporate the cost of provisioning. Prices for basic telecommunications would be different depending on the service area. MTS Allstream believes that competitive forces will assist in keeping the market rates of the services at a fair and competitive rate. When thinking about costing, there are two key considerations when it comes to the voice basic service objectives and these are parity between HCSA and non-HCSA, and affordability for the vast majority of customers. As indicated in its intervention, MTS Allstream does not believe the basic service objective should be extended to broadband. Market forces have achieved near ubiquitous : coverage (or better). The broadband market is competitive with many competitors (ILEC, cable providers, fixed wireless and satellite companies).

We have asked you to redraft the Basic Service Objective to place broadband access at its core:   individual line local broadbandtouch-tone service; and   capability to connect to the Internet via highlow-speed data transmission made available, where feasible, at reasonable wholesalelocal rates;   access to the long distance network, operator/directory assistance services, enhanced calling features and privacy protection features, emergency services, as well as voice message relay service; and   a printed copy of the current local telephone directory upon request. The old Basic Service Objective was very clear on the capability to connect to the Internet via low-speed data transmission. The new Objective needs to be about high-speed data transmission. But, respectfully, the distinction at its core—the capability to connect to an Internet provider—must stay. TekSavvy Solutions Inc.  April  TNC - Oral Presentation regulatory@teksavvy.ca Page    Broadband access is physical network access delivered at the lowest layer of the telecommunications reference model that is practical to deliver it—bundled with no more than has to be.  Internet service is a connectivity service, delivered over broadband access. We think that both Internet service and broadband access are required to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital society, including the digital economy. And both are basic, as opposed to enhanced services. But your job in this proceeding is not to draw lines to identify which services are basic services and which are enhanced services [TD -]. Your job is to identify which basic services are so important, and so scarce, that all Canadians ought to have access to them. We say the answer is upgradable broadband access that supports the provision of retail Internet services. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 351c3aeab7734cbefa3f7682ca61a4a1a9355e02fb549f22402d7e86ba625592
In addition, the very high-speed plans being referred to in the quote above are in limited supply. When the US incumbents complained to the FCC last January about setting the threshold definition of broadband at  Mbps down and  Mbps up, Chairman Wheeler and his staff dismissed the industry’s self-serving comments -- which included Verizon’s claim that the old standard based on  Mps down and Mbps up was actually “popular and worth keeping.”  . As a matter of fact, Canada does poorly relative to its OECD peers with respect to actual wireline download speeds, for example, with a mean actual download speed of . Mbps, ranking rd of  countries -- again with very little sign of improvement relative to its peers over the years (see Table  in the Appendix). To be sure, available speeds in Canada have risen over time, from . Mbps in  to . Mbps in , then . Mbps in . That increase, however, has not kept pace with other countries that have ranked ahead of Canada over the years (see Appendix, Table ). Pricing and Affordability . The Commission promised to monitor the situation with respect to broadband speed and uptake in its last BSO decision,  but it has focused far more on availability and geography rather than price and adoption. The Communications Monitoring Report, for example, contains just one table on broadband adoption (Table ..) and two for household expenditures on a general set of communication services by income quintiles (Table .. and ..). In sharp contrast, there are numerous tables and figures covering availability and subscriptions. This monitoring effort does not match what studies consistently identify as the most important variables affecting uptake: income, education, age and desire. The Commission has also given some but limited attention to the international context relative to the standards of the FCC or Ofcom, for instance.

If, and only to the extent that C-BIAN fails to support existing service providers, and  attract new service providers, then CBBC submits that the ILEC BSO should be revised  to require ILECs to provide modern telecommunications services in their operating  territory where there is no evidence of resilient competition, where it does not appear  that competition will become manifest and where incentive programs have failed to  entice new service providers to begin providing modern telecommunications services. CBBC is also of the view that ILECs should be obligated to provide such modern   services as part of the BSO in the following instances:  () in all non-forborne  exchanges; and () in those forborne exchanges where there are no alternate  broadband service providers that are actually offering modern telecommunications  services to at least % of the entire exchange on a sustainable basis. In the event that  the ILEC is able to demonstrate to the Commission’s satisfaction that an alternate  service provider is actually providing alternate modern telecommunications services to  at least % of the entire exchange, the ILEC would then be at liberty to apply for  service forbearance.  - Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications  service? What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications  services? CBBC respectfully submits that BIA service should be defined as a basic  telecommunications service and that this approach would clearly meet the s. (a) (b)  and (h) objectives of the Telecommunications Act. CBBC expresses no views as to  what other services should or should not be defined as basic telecommunication  services.  - What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service subsidy regime? What resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory frameworks  (e.g. CBBC respectfully submits that were the Commission to redefine the BSO to include the  provision of BIA services the Commission might also be required to determine whether  or not there should be alterations to the local service subsidy regime.

Your response should address, with supporting rationale, which TSPs should be required  to contribute to the NCF, which revenues should be contribution-eligible and which  revenues, if any, should be excluded from the calculation of contribution-eligible  revenues. CBBC does not feel that it is sufficiently acquainted with the contribution collection  mechanism to offer any meaningful input with one exception. That is, CBBC  respectfully submits that if the Commission is not inclined to include BIA services as  part of the BSO, then any alternate service provider that wants to provide such services  in unserved/underserved/forborne/non-forborne service areas should be permitted to  draw from the national contribution fund (the “NCF”) in order to offset a significant part  of the capital and operating cost of providing any services that they provide  notwithstanding the fact that such entities are not contributors to the NCF. The logic for this is simple:  if the ILEC is not required to provide the service and if there   are no other existing programs available to offset at least some of the alternate service  providers’ costs, funding must come from somewhere so as “to render reliable and  affordable telecommunications services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both  urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada” and “to respond to the economic and  social requirements of users of telecommunications services” (s. (b)(h)) . Accordingly,  to the extent that funding is not otherwise available, alternate service providers should  be able to draw upon the NCF.  - Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications  services be subsidized? Explain, with supporting details, which services should be  subsidized and under what circumstances. CBBC respectfully submits that BIA services should be included as part of the ILEC   BSO where other programs, such as federal/provincial subsidy initiatives or, say  regulatory initiatives such as C-BIAN, fail to attract alternate BIA service providers. Then and only then, if ILECs can demonstrate to the Commission’s regulatory  satisfaction that subsidies are required by ILECs in order to provide such services,  should ILECs be permitted to apply for subsidies. If there is a need to establish a new funding mechanism to support the provision of  modern telecommunications services, describe how this mechanism would operate. Your  response should address the mechanism described in Telecom Regulatory Policy -  for transport services and/or any other mechanism necessary to support modern  telecommunications services across Canada.

A focus on broadband deployment, monitoring and enforcement of service standards   and increasing the affordability of telecommunications services including broadband  Internet is necessary for the objectives of the Telecommunications Act to be met. In doing so, there is a potential to have a real impact in the daily lives of Northern  First Nations. They should not continue to be treated as second-class citizens when it  comes to quality, reliable and affordable access to telecommunications services,  including broadband Internet services. The Internet is the “new centre” for MKO First Nations. Any regulatory action must   consider the unique circumstances of MKO and other Northern First Nations. The time to include broadband Internet services in the basic service objective is now. - END OF DOCUMENT - OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 5d46203df0f82300374ca57f53067eafdf67c1b1212654cfca5122d40f7774ad
(a) How would the reduction of choice of TSPs proposed by AAC benefit consumers? (b) In a competitive environment featuring multiple TSPs, on what basis would imposing the types of regulatory consequences envisioned on all TSPs be justified, and what would be the economic consequences and social welfare losses associated with that degree of intervention? (a) The proposed upgrade of the basic service objective is the benefit to consumers and one which outweighs any brief and transient reduction in choice of TSPs offering subpar service. Canadian consumers deserve, and the Telecommunications Act[footnoteRef:] policy objectives require, notably, “reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality”. Ensuring reliable and high-quality services means the Commission must ensure telecommunications service providers (“TSPs”) upgrade periodically to offer baseline services that are essential for customers to communicate in efficient and timely ways. This is the core of the basic service objective. [:  	Telecommunications Act, SC , ss. In the AAC’s submission on this point (at paras. -), the AAC noted that the CRTC could use an entire enforcement spectrum to encourage this upgrade.

Given the federal government's engagement with First Nations through the implementation of the  recommendations found in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report and UNDRIP, MKO  recommends that targeted federal funding be directed towards high need areas, such as remote and  rural First Nations, where broadband services do not meet the minimum standard set by the CRTC. This would ensure equal access to essential services to First Nations. Any additional government  assistance should be built into the BDFM to achieve common goals more quickly, rather than  through a separate program. Recommendations    Whether or not there is a national broadband strategy in place currently, there is a duty to act  immediately towards full broadband deployment.  Principles from existing Canadians and American precedents should guide the Canadian  broadband deployment plan.  Broadband should be included in the BSO as a basic telecommunications service.  In order to identify connectivity gaps, the necessary bandwidth that should be available to all   Canadians within the BSO should be set by examining standard broadband use in Canadian urban areas. It must also be recognized that remote and rural areas may have a need for higher levels of  broadband service.  All areas of Canada where the BSO is not met should be considered gaps in connectivity.  If there is a need to determine priorities within the broadband deployment plan, First Nations   should be identified as a first priority, given the provisions for substantive equality in the Charter  and the federal government's commitment to the implementation of UNDRIP in Canada.  The BDFM should be implemented given that it is the best strategy to close or eliminate the  broadband connectivity gaps.

 Act, supra note  at s (b). Page  of   Deployment Funding Mechanism (BDFM), which will need to be combined with the Affordability  Funding Mechanism (AFM) in many remote and isolated First Nations to ensure the sustainability  of service providers. The combination of both mechanisms will be responsive to unique First Nation  experiences. The CRTC is in the best position to take the leadership role in deployment mechanisms to close the  broadband connectivity gaps. Commitment from governments and industry is also desirable, in  addition to consultation with communities that are affected. National Broadband Strategy  . Whether or not there is a national broadband strategy, there is a duty to act flowing from the  CRTC's statutory mandate under the Telecommunications Act, a constitutional imperative under s.  ()(c), and a crying need from those experiencing the broadband connectivity gaps in their daily  lives. If the federal government's promises of unqualified support for the UNDRIP is to have any  meaning, its nation-to-nation relationship with First Nations in Canada cannot exist in an Internet  desert. The CRTC's duty to act in these circumstances cannot be realized through a multi-stakeholders  advisory council, such as the one proposed in these proceedings by Rogers. Assuming Rogers  submissions were well-intentioned, the suggestion of a multi-stakeholders advisory committee is  simply a recipe for delay in actionable solutions. These delays could easily be misconstrued as a  stall tactic piled on over  years of insufficient action where the most vulnerable Canadians are  concerned. The cost of waiting  .

The cost of leaving Canadians behind is too great not to begin to act immediately. In order to determine where these gaps exist, it is necessary to establish the substance of the basic  service objective (BSO), or in other words, the minimum level of service or the basic  telecommunications services required in all regions of Canada. Anywhere in Canada that does not    CRTC, “Communications Monitoring Report, October”, , at p  [CMR ].  Federal Communications Commission, “Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan”, p xi-xiv. Page  of   meet the BSO should be considered a gap in access to connectivity. What are “basic telecommunications services” in the basic service objective? In determining which telecommunications services are contained within the BSO, it is important to  keep in mind the CRTC's ongoing efforts around inclusion:  Over the past several years, the CRTC has strengthened its efforts to place Canadians at the centre of the communications system, whether as consumers of communication products and services, creators and distributors of content, or citizens who need access to information to fully engage in a democratic society. Where the CRTC makes references to “Canadians”, it has already committed to include Canadians  everywhere, in all regions, whether urban, rural or remote:  The Commission notes that the primary goal of the obligation to serve and the basic service  objective  is  for  all  Canadians,  regardless  of  where  they  reside,  to  have reasonable access to basic telecommunications services. [emphasis added]  . Given the essential and vital nature of broadband emphasized by intervenors in this proceeding and  recognized by the CRTC, there should be no question that broadband must be included as a basic  telecommunications service in the BSO. However, in order to determine where gaps in accessibility to broadband service exist, the BSO  must include minimum standards of basic telecommunications services, including broadband. Once  there is a definition of basic broadband service, areas where this level of service is not available to  Canadians can be mapped out and identified for the purposes of filling those gaps through a  broadband deployment mechanism.

The BSO should not be based on specific uses of the Internet. It would be very difficult, if not  impossible, to monitor uses of the Internet. In addition, there would be no way of knowing whether  a specific use is purely for entertainment or if it is used to fulfill a legitimate need. Instead, the  minimum standard available to all Canadians should be based on the demand, which is reflected by  the services available in large urban centres in Canada. Rather than making a judgment call relating  to the services that Canadians need, the CRTC should look at the level available to most Canadians. All Canadians should have access to this level of service. Indeed, the CRTC has referred to the BSO  as reflecting “the level of service available at the time to most Canadians.”  .

Government funding should be incorporated into the BDFM to avoid duplicating  efforts. The time to act is now and the opportunity must be seized to ensure that all Canadians, regardless  of where they live, have access to reliable and affordable high quality broadband services. Recommendations   . Whether or not there is a national broadband strategy in place currently, there is a duty to act  immediately towards full broadband deployment. Principles from existing Canadians and American precedents should guide the Canadian  broadband deployment plan. Broadband should be included in the BSO as a basic telecommunications service. In order to identify connectivity gaps, the necessary bandwidth that should be available to all   Canadians within the BSO should be set by examining standard broadband use in Canadian  urban areas. It must also be recognized that remote and rural areas may have a need for higher  levels of broadband service. All areas of Canada where the BSO is not met should be considered gaps in connectivity. If there is a need to determine priorities within the broadband deployment plan, First Nations   should be identified as a first priority, given the provisions for substantive equality in the  Charter and the federal government's commitment to the implementation of UNDRIP in  Canada. The BDFM should be implemented given that it is the best strategy to close or eliminate the  broadband connectivity gaps.

Using the proceeds of spectrum auctions to fund the general Treasury budget is also inefficient and akin to a tax on communications services whereas the goal of improving adoption levels should be to tax such services as little as possible. However, when other policy goals indicate the value of using a policy tool like spectrum auctions, i.e. efficiently allocating access to a scarce public resource like spectrum, the use of the tool should be limited and as precisely targeted as possible at furthering the specific aims of telecommunications-internet policy rather than to further general policy aims out of the general budget. This also furthers the aim of achieving as much transparency as possible in terms of setting the purpose and use of public policy tools. Austria, for instance, took this approach recently when it specifically setting aside half of the proceeds from its most recent spectrum auction (€ billion) for the purpose of increasing access to next generation access networks, i.e. broadband internet connections with speeds of  Mbps or more. -- END --  � A list of jurisdictions that have adopted such plans can be found in Annex  of the Broadband Commission’s State of Broadband  report. �HYPERLINK "http://www.broadbandcommission.org/documents/reports/bb-annualreport.pdf"�http://www.broadbandcommission.org/documents/reports/bb-annualreport.pdf�. � FCC  Broadband Progress Report. https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/-broadband-progress-report  � FCC ().

First, the data that would meet CNOC’s purpose stated above are   already available from the CMR. Section .(h) of the  CMR provides   broadband availability based on technologies, territories, speeds, urban versus   rural, and in combinations of these factors. Specifically, Table .., Broadband   availability, by speed and province/territory (percentage of households), fulfils   precisely this purpose. The table provides the data in aggregate by speed and by     TELUS Communications Company  TNC -   October ,   Responses to request for disclosure      and further responses          territory, thereby providing CNOC with a better understanding of the speeds   available by territory. Second, the disaggregated data that CNOC seeks are of limited use, because   TELUS is not the only broadband service provider providing service in its   operating territory. High-speed Internet access service at these speeds are   available from other service providers. Therefore, the data provided in the RFI   are not fully indicative of the availability of broadband at various speeds in   TELUS’ territory. Third, in Bulletin -, the Commission found “that the more the   information is disaggregated or the greater the degree of competition, the more   likely it is that the direct harm will outweigh the public interest and that the   information should not be disclosed.” In the case at hand the data are highly   disaggregated, and the broadband market is very competitive. These three facts   alone justify TELUS’ assertion of confidentiality. Fourth, and in any event, in this request for disclosure, CNOC also requests that   the JTF provide its data in aggregate. With CNOC’s stated purpose to better   understand speeds availability, the type of information already made publicly   available by the Commission in the CMR provides sufficient information.

Bragg(TELUS)November-        Refer to Eastlink’s answer to Request for Information  Bragg(CRTC)August-. a) Eastlink states that many “essential uses” of broadband Internet, including  banking, online transaction, information access, education and e-health, can be  provided with speeds up to / Mbps. Is it Eastlink’s position that there are other  “essential uses” that require greater speeds? If so, what uses, and at what  speeds? b) Eastlink states that the only viable long term solution for household broadband  Internet is “a wireline technology which will provide the network required to meet  the ever evolving capacity needs of consumers.”  Eastlink further states that in  underserved areas, provided a business case exists, Eastlink’s “preference  would be to provide services over a fixed wireline network similar to the robust  wireline networks we build elsewhere, with sufficient capacity to fulfil ongoing  and future needs.”  Eastlink then states that it does “not necessarily support a  subsidy regime that will provide endless funds available for the best technologies  to underserved areas.”  In turn, Eastlink’s first intervention states at paragraph   that “[w]here the business case is difficult, a combination of government funding  and industry initiatives may also work.”  Given that Eastlink is of the opinion that  the only viable solution is a robust wireline network, how specifically does  Eastlink propose to fund broadband internet in remote regions where there is no  viable business case? a)  Eastlink submits that essential uses of broadband internet include those used for  banking, online transactions, information access, education, e-health and other similar  services. It was our submission that generally, these uses can be achieved with speeds  up to / Mbps. We are not aware of any other essential uses that would require higher  speeds. b) Eastlink would like to clarify that our submission was intended to provide an example  of our past experience with fixed wireless technology, and the associated difficulties we  experienced meeting customers’ expectations within the limitations of that service,  primarily given increased capacity usage by consumers beyond what the service was  intended to provide.

In describing the current Proceeding, the CRTC stated that its purpose is “to  ensure that Canadians have access to world-class telecommunications services  that will allow them to participate actively in the digital economy”. The US and  European plans provide a compelling guideline as to the targets that the CRTC  should establish. The GNWT believes that a high speed Internet target of  Mbps download and    Mbps upload by  should replace the existing / target. The GNWT also  recommends that a minimum usage allowance of  GB be established, this  level being one which is currently provided to % of all Canadians and which  percentage is growing annually.  As well, the GNWT considers that the target  speeds should refer to actual speeds which are normally available and not  simply to advertised speeds which may be occasionally, if ever, achieved.  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/our-goals/pillar-iv-fast-and-ultra-fast-internet-access#Article   http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=   CRTC  Communications Monitoring Report, Figure ...  http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/PolicyMonitoring//cmr.htm   …/   http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/our-goals/pillar-iv-fast-and-ultra-fast-internet-access#Article http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid= http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/PolicyMonitoring//cmr.htm   --   Question . Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic  telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully  participate in the digital economy? The term “basic service” is not defined in the Telecommunications Act and while the   Commission identified in Telecom Decision - the services it then considered to  be basic it did not explicitly provide a set of detailed criteria that a service must  satisfy to be so considered. Rather, it stated at paragraphs  and  of the  Decision that:     . Incumbent local carriers continue to improve service to their customers. These improvements, in turn, raise Canadians' expectations of what should  constitute basic service. However, the Commission found evidence that some  companies provide lower levels of service in high-cost areas. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER e1793273cbae49f75b503aad972e22815d4812586ee31324f50953f4bd8cc2df
If so, what  obligations and on which service provider(s)? Rules relating to terms, conditions and service characteristics for residential local  service have already been established. Terms and conditions that would need to be established for high speed Internet  service, if identified as an additional basic service, would include minimum  download and upload speeds and an associated minimum usage allowance,  together with a requirement that actual speeds meet or exceed the specified  minimums. In areas such as Northwestel’s, where there is insufficient competition to ensure that  all users can obtain the specified basic service it will be essential to establish an  obligation to serve with respect to this basic service component. From a practical  perspective we believe this obligation to serve should rest with the incumbent,  Northwestel but that the company should be freed of the obligation with respect to  any specific user, where it demonstrates that another provider is providing or is  willing to provide service subject to the terms and conditions specified in the  obligation to serve. Question (c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and  how should these prices be determined? In the case of residential local telephone service the CRTC has already established  a price ceiling of $ a month adjusted by the rate of inflation.  This rate appears  to have been struck based largely on finding a threshold which was only marginally  above the highest rate charged in all but a few areas. The GNWT does not at this  time have the underlying data that would be necessary to determine what would be  the equivalent threshold rate for high speed Internet service. A very rough estimate  taken from a limited review of online advertised non-promotional rates suggests that  for / high speed Internet with a usage allowance of  GB an appropriate  maximum might be in the order of $. Any charges for excess usage should be  minimal.  Some rates, including those charged by Northwestel, were already slightly above $ at the time this  policy was adopted and have remained at such higher levels subject to inflationary increases.

In the current Proceeding the GNWT is recommending that the basic service  objective be amended to include high speed Internet service with minimum speeds  of  Mbps download and  Mbps upload, a minimum usage allowance of  GB,  and subject to an affordable price ceiling currently suggested to be in the area $. We suggest that initially, the basic service objective should apply in both regulated  and forborne exchanges because:   • high speed internet is a relatively new service  • the current subscriber penetration of high speed internet service is not as   high as for local service  • service at the proposed target speeds is currently not even available in most   Northern communities  • except in Northwestel’s territory, Internet service is not regulated. In considering how the obligation to serve for this new component of the basic  service objective should be imposed, the GNWT sees no need to modify the  existing rules that apply to residential local service. Accordingly, the obligation to  provide high speed Internet at the specified minimum speeds would be applied to  ILECs in both regulated and forborne exchanges.  Where rates are not regulated,  prices would be subject to the maximum price ceiling we have tentatively suggested  be set in the $ monthly range. We see no reason to apply the obligation to non- ILECs for the same reasons as in the case of residential local service.

What changes, if any, should be made to the contribution collection  mechanism? Your response should address, with supporting rationale, which TSPs  should be required to contribute to the NCF, which revenues should be contribution- eligible and which revenues, if any, should be excluded from the calculation of  contribution-eligible revenues. Pursuant to Telecom Circular CRTC - and the Telecommunications   Fees Regulations, , all TSPs with telecommunications revenues in excess  of $ million a year are required to pay a small percentage of their contribution  eligible revenues into a fund to support CRTC costs including those of the NCF. Contribution eligible revenues are defined as total telecommunications  revenues net of various deductions, one of which is “retail Internet service  revenues”. With the proposed inclusion of NCF funding for  new high speed  Internet service subsidies the GNWT would propose that this deduction be  eliminated. Should some or all services that are considered to be basic  telecommunications services be subsidized? Explain, with supporting details, which  services should be subsidized and under what circumstances. The GNWT believes that all basic services should be eligible for subsidy support   and notes that section () of the Telecommunications Act does not identify any  class of basic services for which subsidy support would automatically not be  considered. This does not however imply that all basic services actually require a  subsidy. Rather, such subsidies should only be considered where they will further  achievement of the Act’s objectives. Accordingly the GNWT believes that subsidies should generally only be used where  market forces will not ensure the availability of a basic service at affordable prices in  all regions of Canada.

Taking this view seriously might encourage the Commission to refrain   from recognizing broadband access as a basic service, while letting other federal departments,   provinces, and municipalities address the gaps, or set up some form of advisory council to study   how best to move forward. OpenMedia disagrees that issues related to the digital divide do not   warrant concerted action by the Commission; and we also note it was clearly Parliament's   intention to provide the Commission with the legal authority to make determinations about the   range of basic telecommunications services, in addition to mandating minimum standards of   service reliability, and requiring regulated entities to contribute to resolving gaps in the quality and   affordability of services the Commission determines to be basic. The suggestion by some that an ad hoc advisory council should replace the Commission in   designing Canada’s basic services regime would be ill-advised and counter-productive, not least   because doing so would seriously undermine the Commission's credibility. The creation of a   substitute body would also run counter to due process, as it would do violence to the views   expressed by the wide range of Canadians and communities that have participated in this   proceeding. The OpenMedia community submits that it is in the public interest for the   Commission to take the lead in developing innovative and effective policy solutions to address the   substantive gaps in Internet service identified on the record of this proceeding. Towards a mandated basic service strategy     . We thank the Commission for its thorough and insightful inquiry during the oral hearing into   OpenMedia’s recommendation for the adoption of a basic service package based on minimum   standards of service. In this final submission, we further explore some of the questions raised by   the Commission regarding this proposed approach. OpenMedia does not suggest that this   approach would be sufficient in itself to counteract rural market failures or affordability constraints   on low income vulnerable populations such as Canadians with severe disabilities or children from   poor families. Our proposal, which would minimize interference with market forces, would not   restrict the range of services that operators can offer. For example, some operators may choose   to offer even cheaper non-mandated basic service packages that do not include minimum service       	  quality guarantees, or services advertising ultra-fast, symmetric speeds in the hundreds of   megabits per second.

Concern: There is lack of visually accessible emergency information when on the road or at home of announcements that are auditory in nature – radio, PA, blackberry pagers, cellphones, I-Phone, I-PAD, and latest communication technologies  Recommendation: CRTC set regulations requiring the emergency communication industries to provide text based information to cell phone, text services and other such devices and service providers in order to ensure culturally Deaf, oral deaf people, deafened and hard of hearing individuals have access to up-to-date emergency information in the cases, for example, of natural disasters, weather warnings, amber alerts, traffic accidents, etc. Broadband and Dataplan Affordability  . Concern: The data plans in both residential and on mobile devices are significantly more expensive for Deaf people and hard of hearing people who cannot and understand voice telephone. Forcing to have voice plan under their mobile device and needing more data for video calls and so on is an additional cost. Recommendation: Cost for mobile and residential internet data plans should be the same cost as what most Canadians pay; however, the functional equivalence would be to remove the voice plan and the minutes need to be translated to data. Often mobile providers provide unlimited local minutes and reduce long distance charges. This needs to be reflected in a dat plan that would provide unlimited local data, etc. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER a725094d4f93bcb5593c44d32cf99cc543175c3500d46cf9df2004fa8567c571

Yellow Pages Limited   Response to Undertaking  May ,   TNC -    Page  of       approve the opt-in distribution policy for residential directories appears to have been predicated on  safeguard measures made possible through the continued mass distribution of business directories  on an annual basis:    “YPG indicated that important information currently contained in the white pages,  such as individual business listings and the government listings as well as  emergency contact numbers and Commission mandated information requirements,  would be updated and distributed annually in the yellow pages to all residential  subscribers. YPG proposed to adopt a comprehensive communication plan in order to notify  customers of the new “on-demand” distribution plan, which would include general  and market specific press releases announcing the implementation dates for each  city, and the means by which customers could request a free copy of the white  pages. In addition, the yellow pages directory would include several notices on how  to obtain a free copy of the current white pages directory, including on the cover,  spine and various pages in the yellow pages directory.”   VI. Opt-in directory distribution policy for residential directories in non-forborne  markets   Although the policy change approved by the letter sent by the CRTC to YP in  with respect to  the opt-in distribution approach for residential directories applied only to forborne markets, the CRTC  subsequently extended the opt-in approach for the distribution of residential directories to the  remaining non-forborne markets. In a  decision on the basic service objective, the CRTC  stated as follows:   “. With respect to the distribution of the white pages in regulated exchanges, the  Commission concludes that, consistent with its policy for forborne exchanges, it is  appropriate to allow ILECs to choose to make print copies of the white pages  available only upon request in regulated exchanges, subject to certain conditions.”   The corresponding footnote to this statement reads as follows:   “The conditions associated with on-request distribution include appropriate  safeguards and billing inserts (providing notification regarding distribution plans and  the means to obtain a print copy), and inclusion of Commission-mandated  information requirements (emergency numbers) in the Yellow Pages directory. See  file numbers -C-, -T-, and -B-/.”   As a result of this change in policy in , the basic service objective for all ILECs in Canada has  been modified so that there is no longer a general requirement to mass distribute residential  directories in Canada in non-forborne markets. However, consistent with the approach taken by the  CRTC in forborne markets, there remains a clear and continuing basic service obligation to provide  residential directories to customers upon request. There also remains in place a continuing obligation for ILECs to mass distribute business directories.

May ,                     -  -         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   . In this proceeding, the Commission reviewed the progress made by the  telecommunications  industry since  in meeting the Commission’s target of making  Internet access service available to all Canadians by  at speeds of  Mbps download  and  Mbps Upload (hereafter referred to as “/ Mbps”). The Commission also asked  whether service at this speed should be made part of the basic service obligation, to whom  that obligation should apply, whether the contribution regime should be altered to provide  a subsidy for the provision of this level of service and, if so, in what circumstances, or  whether a new subsidy is required. The Commission also asked Intervenors to comment  on whether the existing subsidy for the provision of local telephone service to high cost  service areas should be altered or eliminated. The observations of Xplornet Communications Inc. (“Xplornet”) regarding the evidence  presented during this preceding are summarized below. Basic Service Definition   . The evidence presented in this proceeding shows that great progress has been made to  satisfy the / Mbps service target. Service at this speed is now available in virtually every  part of Canada. The Commission can take some credit for this accomplishment because it  set this standard and gave the industry a common bench mark to aim for by the end of . Xplornet believes the Commission’s  target goal of  Mbps download and  Mbps  upload should now be considered the basic service level. As illustrated in CRTC Exhibit  , the ability to use email, electronic banking services, software updates, being able to  search for educational or health information, and the ability to access government services,  form the basis of what defines basic service.

Xplornet strongly encourages the Commission to endorse the practice of other jurisdictions  in utilizing the best-fit technology to address Canada’s challenging population densities,  topography and climatic conditions. Fibre makes sense in urban and suburban  neighbourhoods, fixed wireless makes sense in lower density communities that can support  tower and backhaul facilities, and satellite makes sense in very low population areas. Such an approach would mirror the experience of numerous other countries that have  pursued broadband access plans. This includes Australia and New Zealand with low  population densities, countries with higher population densities, such as Sweden, as well  as the rural and remote areas of Europe and the United States. In the United States,  approximately . million households use satellite for broadband access. Affordability of the Internet   . Xplornet acknowledges that for some Canadians, affordability of broadband is a serious  concern. Indeed, not all Canadians can afford service at / Mbps or, in some cases, at any  speed. As revealed in the statistical evidence in this proceeding, there are approximately  % of Canadians that do not currently have Internet access at home. Of those Canadians  who do not to connect to the Internet, almost one-third (%) identify cost as a reason for  not subscribing. Unlike the cost of local telephone service which was affected by certain high costs of  reaching distant serving areas, affordability of the Internet is an issue for a segment of the  population in rural, remote and urban areas.

Xplornet has grown to become the largest rural  Internet service provider in Canada by focusing exclusively on areas of Canada not served  by wired solutions. Our customers are in every province and territory. While some live in  the most remote locations of our country, most of our customers are just outside major  urban cities. In this submission, Xplornet comments on the central issues raised in Telecom Notice of  Consultation CRTC -, Review of Basic Telecommunications Services, and at the  public proceeding convened by the Commission. Regard should also be had to the  Intervention filed by Xplornet on July , , and the supplementary intervention filed  on February , , as well as the responses to the various rounds of interrogatories and  the responses to undertakings filed on May , . BROADBAND INTERNET IS A BASIC SERVICE   . Based on the legal definition and the passionate response of Canadians in these  proceedings, there is little doubt that broadband Internet access has become a basic  telecommunications service in Canada. It is used daily by more than % of Canadians to  communicate with each other, with businesses, community organizations, schools,  governments and other institutions. It enables business, banking, education, social  interaction. It delivers the news and it entertains. It has become part of our everyday lives  and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future as the “Internet of Things” expands.

 The Commission’s  target of  megabits per second download and   megabit per second upload should now be considered the basic service level.  Conversely, playing real-time video games, or, replacing your TV service  with video streaming, are “wants” and not “needs”. Canadians want these services. As an industry, we are investing to meet this market demand. But they are not a  necessity. Xplornet does not believe that the basic service standard needs to support high definition  video services. While more television and movie content is now being made available via  the Internet, the Commission itself has not supported a wholesale abandonment of the  broadcasting distribution industry and services like Netflix, while popular, do not  contribute to the Canadian broadcasting system. In fact, video distribution in and of itself  is not a basic telecommunications service today, nor should be. As such, basic Internet  service should not be viewed as a replacement for cable TV or other broadcasting  distribution undertakings. Xplornet therefore supports a basic service standard of / Mbps  for broadband Internet access to meet the needs - not the wants - of consumers. Excluding “wants” from the definition of basic telecommunication service does not mean  ISPs will not provide services that meet those “wants”.

press and broadcasting) already enjoy the rights and protections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it is time to bring broadband internet into the fold. Second, our assertion in this regard is meant to highlight the normative elements implicated by the basic service obligation review versus the tendency within this context for many industry players and other experts to focus solely on economic and technical considerations. Underpinning our argument is the assumption that a better balance between technical and economic issues, on the one hand, and the normative dimension of communication issues, on the other, is needed. We are also mindful of the fact that, as we note in our revised submission (para ), the Commission made only a single reference to the word “freedom” in its last decision on this matter (-), and even that was couched in concerns with consumer choice. [footnoteRef:] We believe that the Commission should think of these issues in a broader way and one that is consistent with Chairman Blais’ own insistence in many speeches that the CRTC deals with citizens’ issues not just consumer ones. [:  CRTC, -, para . ] Finally, the evolutionary view of communication rights that we are advocating is consistent with international trends. Thus, as we outline in our initial submission, and more fully explicate in our revised brief (see paras -), we can see this more expansive view in, for example, the following instances:   . The EU’s  Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications Networks and Services explicitly “recognizes that the Internet is essential for education and for the practical exercise of freedom of expression and access to information”. [footnoteRef:] This brings broadband internet within the ambit of universal service while also casting it within the scope of Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights on freedom of expression; [:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:::::EN:PDF]   . the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression by Frank La Rue for the UN Human Rights Commission made the case in  for Internet access and freedom of expression on the Internet as a basic human right;  .  	the U.S. and Sweden sponsored a resolution passed by the UN Human Rights Council of which Canada is a part that reaffirms the applicability of Article XIX to the Internet and that “call[ed] upon all States to promote and facilitate access to the Internet”.

Symbolically and legally, we think such measures strike an important note in an era in which more and more of our lives are immersed within ‘the internet-of-everything’. Thus, the more expansive and rights-based approach to broadband internet that we are advocating is consistent with the historical evolution of rights as well as in line with international trends and the spirit of measures that Canada has agreed to on the world stage. It is time to make such commitments more meaningful and palpable at home. It is also consistent with Canada’s historical role as a leader not just in the advanced technological state of its communication system but in the discourse of communication rights and freedom on the world stage, perhaps best marked by the leading role that the McGill law professor John Humphreys played in penning the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially Article XIX. It is also forward looking and stakes out some of the ideals of what citizens’ communication rights look like in the internet era. Premable  Para.  of the CMCRP’s first intervention ( July ) states: “Policy makers have debated for  years over how best to achieve universal telecommunications service.” Please refer to para. A of Shaw’s intervention, which states: “In today’s ever-changing technological environment, where a diversity of networks, services and technologies compete in order to meet a variety of consumer needs, the concept of a ‘basic service objective’ is ill-suited and anachronistic.”   Question   On what basis does the CMCRP assert the continued relevance, after  years, of universal or basic telecommunications service objective for Canadians today? Response   Our response to this question is similar to what was suggested in response to your last question and to Catherine Middleton’s first question. Namely, that in these matters we need to take an evolutionary view of rights and obligations that match the technological and economic conditions of our times rather than hew to a static conception that tethers these issues to the past, and to past technologies. While the technological and economic conditions to which Shaw points may now be anachronistic, the fundamental values and principles associated with universal service are not.

Finally, broadband Internet services are a complete substitute for the low-speed Internet service included in the current basic service objective. : -C- 	Page  of  INFORMATION REQUESTED BY CANADIAN RADIO-television & TELECOMMUNICATIONS cOMMISSION  (crtc)   Rogers Communications		Response to Interrogatory September , 		Rogers(CRTC)Aug-- 		TNC CRTC- Ref. In response to request for information Rogers(CRTC)May-, the company provided its three most popular Internet plans which provide higher speeds than the ones proposed by Rogers in its intervention for the basic service objective and for the " target". Explain, with supporting rationale, why the target speeds specified in Rogers’ proposed basic service objective and " target" are lower than the most popular plans to which Rogers’ customers subscribe. A.  Rogers is of the view that the basic service objective should include Internet service with a minimum speed of  Mbps download and  Mbps upload. Rogers considers a service with this speed profile is sufficient to meet the basic needs of consumers and will enable them to use key Internet applications such as web browsing, email, VoIP, social media and basic video streaming. The speeds of Rogers’ Internet plans that are the most popular with our customers are not representative of the minimum speeds necessary to fulfill these basic needs. There are any number of reasons why consumers choose Internet plans that provide speeds higher than those described in Rogers’ intervention. As Rogers indicated in response to the Commission’s questions in the Notice of Consultation, services and applications that are important for one individual’s use may not be important for another. Some users may want to engage in applications, such as video streaming or online gaming services that benefit from higher speed services.

Shortly thereafter, Rogers launched an Internet plan with speeds of / Mbps at a monthly retail price of $.. This is a very competitive price point for an Internet service with this speed profile. As the Internet is now a mature market with high penetration levels, subscriber growth is challenging. Rogers has introduced this new plan in an attempt to drive subscriber growth in a market segment where it did not previously have a competitive offer. Rogers proposed a target speed for  at a level above the minimum speed proposed for the basic service objective. The higher target speed would signal ISPs that they should work towards achieving the target by . Rogers proposed a target speed of  Mbps download and  Mbps upload as an example, for the reasons discussed at paragraphs  and  of our intervention. Rogers notes that other parties in this proceeding proposed similar target speeds of  Mbps download, along with various upload speeds. Rogers is of the view that maintaining the upload target speed for  at  Mbps is reasonable based on the current and anticipated bandwidth requirements of Internet applications. As noted by Cisco in a recent white paper,   “With the exception of short-form video and video calling, most forms of Internet video do not have a large upstream component.

We concur with the Yukon Government that broadband should be included as a  basic service, and that voice service should be retained. Finally, FMCC notes that broadband connectivity can be unreliable, particularly in  rural and remote areas. Short-term or extended power outages can completely  disable broadband connectivity, at the residential or community wide-level —  problems which do not plague traditional voice services. Maintaining traditional  connectivity services is particularly important in the North, and during emergency  situations having a telephone lifeline to the outside world can be a crucial to life and  limb. ***END OF DOCUMENT***    Government of Yukon.

The emergence of Video on   demand applications in the recent years has proposed a unique challenge for small service providers. A   few years ago it was a straightforward solution to providing basic telecommunications. There was   sufficient wireless frequency to provide what consumers were demanding. With the exponential growth   of Video on Demand, service providers are finding it more difficult to deliver what consumers demand. Video on Demand is saturating our networks and is eroding what we feel is basic telecommunications. But what is basic telecommunications? I’m sure in Nunavut the description would be different than in   central Alberta. Regardless of what that is defined as, we know that the more internet access given, the   more uses are found from that access. Regardless of what basic telecommunications are defined as, Consumers are unhappy with their service   if they cannot do what they want on the internet. In the past  years, our prices have remained the   same, but our service offering of speed and data have increased  and  fold. This has a serious impact   on Return on Investment and the feasibility of delivering service. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER f27af65595cf05af78f04fa752c99b597af38cd0d84050fa71f98846ef282bc5

As is hopefully evident in our submission, SaskTel continues to believe that voice connections are more critical than broadband connections and thus dependability and reliability is more important with respect to voice service than with respect to broadband. SaskTel pointed out some of the potential concerns with using wireless service as a replacement for a truly critical wireline voice service in our comments of  April  in Telecom Notice of Consultation -, Proceeding to review access to basic telecommunications services and other matters when we stated: · Especially in rural areas, cellular service does not provide the same consistent, nearly ubiquitous, coverage as wireline local service. Cellular reception is best in the open air; degrades somewhat within vehicles; and is at its worst within buildings. This makes cellular a less effective substitute for local wireline service, which is intended to function within buildings.

Forming part of   the same trend, % of mobile wireless subscribers are currently identified as being   data-only subscribers.   . In summary, driven by competitive pressures and supported by government   funding, the choice of broadband speed has greatly expanded in Canada during the   last five years. Not only will most Canadian households soon have access to the   current / Mbps target speed established by the Commission, but several higher   speeds of wireline and wireless Internet services are now offered and largely   available in the Canadian market. No doubt, this trend will continue to grow during the   next five years. Redefining the basic telecommunications services objective and its application   . As described above, the highly dynamic competitive market environment and the   evolution of wireline, wireless and satellite telecommunications technologies have   made available a large diversity of telephony and broadband services in the Canadian   market. Taking into account this market reality, Cogeco remains of the view that the   Commission's regulatory framework should continue to be cognizant of the fact that   most Canadians have the possibility of exercising choice in the current context among   several telephony and broadband services available from competitive TSPs to   support their diversified basic telecommunications needs.

Cogeco shares the view expressed by other interveners that the / Mbps is still   sufficient to meet the minimum basic Internet needs to allow participation in the digital   economy. Furthermore, by so doing, the Commission would redefine the broadband   service benchmark to be used to identify which areas should be considered as   unserved in Canada. However, Cogeco reiterates there is no reason to impose price regulation in the   form of tariff of price caps to all TSPs to meet the basic broadband service objective. Consumers have different broadband needs and can choose among numerous   Internet packages available in the market to meet their specific needs. Indeed, rivalry   among ISPs is strong in the Canadian competitive Internet market, as evidenced over   the years by the multiplication of Internet package offerings, the reduction in price of   Mbps, and the availability of promotional offers. COGECO Communications  February ,       Review of basic telecommunications services   Second Intervention – TNC -   Page  of            . With respect to voice services, Cogeco submits that the definition of the basic   voice service included in the BSO should be redefined in order to better reflect the   current usage for voice services of most Canadians. Furthermore, by so doing, the   basic voice service of the BSO would be met not only by the ILECs but by the larger   range of voice providers used by Canadians. Accordingly, Cogeco submits that the   following components of the current basic voice service of the BSO should be phased   out: ) access to the long distance network through the Equal Access requirement;   and, ) access to a printed copy of the current local telephone directory upon request. Cogeco is sharing the view that the Equal Access requirement, as a means for   accessing long distance services, should be removed from the application of the   BSO, given that a very large proportion of telephony customers are now using the   long distance services offered by their local voice providers or are accessing to   Internet phone alternatives such as Skype, Google, MagicJack, etc.. In fact, the   current demand for long distance services provided by alternate interexchange   service providers is very weak.

Yukon recommends implementation of broadband subsidy, funded through the NCF or   separately, but along similar lines. The mechanism would be overseen by the CRTC, be   transparent and efficient, and preserve the option of future competitive supply. There is a clearly recognized need for implementation of a subsidy mechanism to alleviate the   lack of investment in transport infrastructure in the North. Yukon recommends establishment of an obligation to connect as the basis for a transport   subsidy to be funded from a designated federal fund, such as the infrastructure program. The   mechanism would be transparent, with participation of communities, providers and government   stakeholders to develop cooperative solutions and enable other funding support, and would be   overseen by the CRTC. May ,    of    . The limited economic opportunities, lack of facilities investment and limited scope of   competitive choice which characterize the Yukon telecommunications environment are barriers   to achieving telecommunications policy goals. A further, and more significant barrier is the concentration of ownership by Northwestel and   Bell affiliates of cable, telecom and wireless facilities which precludes the prospect of facilities-  based competition, and eliminates the possibility for Yukon customers to benefit from choice,   price competition, service quality and reliability, and innovation. Yukon views this proceeding as providing the Commission with not only the opportunity to   continue the policies which have successfully balanced regulation and market forces to achieve   a robust competitive market in much of the country, but more importantly to establish   expectations for the future growth and development of Canadians’ participation in the digital   economy by setting forward-looking goals and implementing mechanisms to allow Canadians   who live at the margins—whether geographic, economic or otherwise—the same capability to   thrive in a digital world. The issues involved in this proceeding are vitally important to Canadians and more specifically to   Canadians who live and work in communities like those in Yukon, which are more remote, more   distant and more reliant on fast, affordable, quality access to telecommunications than others in   more populous and accessible regions of the country. Yukon shares the view that this proceeding represents a critical opportunity to define a policy   and implement a solution that will not only address a complex set of challenges as diverse as the   nation, but also to do so in a fashion that will enable Canadians to fully exploit the potential of   present and future telecommunications capabilities to improve their economic prospects,   enhance their social and cultural lives, and improve their access to health, education and   government services.

  Yukon’s comments on the roles of stakeholder advisory groups in the following sections would also be applicable   here.   As the Chairman noted (Ts ) funding that is not focused on clear and specific purposes is like “pouring money   into sand”        May ,    of    . Whether there is a National Broadband Strategy, or an action plan, or simply programs that are   implemented within the context of current regulatory practice, Yukon submits that it is   imperative to act. Canadians at the margins—whether geographic, economic or otherwise—will   not be able to fully realize their potential in a digital society and economy without government   intervention. Yukon and others can and will help, but the CRTC is the only appropriate agency   able to provide the necessary leadership to make this happen. Basic Service     . The concept of basic service is a regulatory construct, originally associated with the extension of   telecommunications connectivity, to provide access throughout the country. As networks were extended, and telephone access became more ubiquitous, expectations for   what should be part of basic service changed to include individual line service, direct dial access   to long distance, and low-speed data connectivity. The approach to defining basic service adopted by the Commission, which Yukon submits   remains relevant today, is a relative one. In thoroughly reviewing the basic service obligation in   Telecom Decision - the Commission began the definition of basic service in these words:   “The Commission considers that the level of service now available to the vast majority   of Canadians should be extended to as many Canadians as feasible in all regions of the   country.”   . In Yukon’s view it remains not only relevant but necessary that the definition of basic service   be considered in this context.

Benjamin LaHaise  Sixth Concession A Dalhousie Lanark, ON KG K  Re: Notice of Consultation CRTC --  . Please find enclosed my thoughts on the matter of the review of basic telecommunications services in Canada. My views are presented from the perspective of a rural resident employed in the high tech industry who has some experience and insight into telecommunications matters derived from having deployed a small amount of fibre based internet services in Lanark County, Ontario. My experience as a third party market participant provides a unique view into some of the technical and business challenges of providing service in a rural high cost to service market. I request to appear at the public hearing. Definition of Basic Telecommunications Service  . As a worker in the high tech industry, I am of the opinion that it is now time for the CRTC to expand the definition of Basic Telecommunications Services to include broadband Internet services. In the s and s, the use of fax machines and dial-up modems made it possible for workers to telecommute while executing many of the tasks performed by office workers. In , high speed Internet services make similar employment arrangements feasible for many additional activities. It is now possible for a telecommuter or artist to download, edit and upload entire movies while working from home if they have access to modern broadband Internet services. As the trend for computing involves the access and use of ever larger data sets, the need for broadband Internet services will continue to expand at an ever increasing rate.

Terminology needs to be created to allow for ASL and LSQ users to navigate   through the wireless contracts to understand what they are getting into, as per  Wireless Code’s “alternative formats.”  The committee recognizes that this should fall  upon the responsibilities of the WSPs or a consortium of these companies. In contrast,  our committee has begun to develop a generic terminology list with the focus on         telecommunications. Currently, the deafwireless.ca website has a webpage focused  on terminology. This web page may eventually be transferred to the CAD-ASC website  in the future. Workshops could be hosted in different cities in each province to educate ASL and   LSQ users. Affordability   . Create an accessibility fund, either originating from a newly created  Telecommunications Accessibility Fund (TAF), or Media Access Canada’s suggested  “National Disabilities Subsidy Fund (NDSF)”, (Reference: DWCC's Second  Intervention) pooled by the WSPs:     a. provide those with low-income to afford smartphones and reasonable data plan   packages to access video communications     b. utilize as a contingency fund for projects to develop educational videos to address   the communication gap; and     c. provide training and employment opportunities for Deaf and Hard of Hearing   employees to provide WSPs customer service directly in sign language.  Mbps for download and upload speeds should be the minimum standard for   all wireless communications including the video communications. This will allow  the ASL and LSQ users have access to best quality videos to correspond in sign  language. The current download/upload speeds are at  Mbps/ Mbps which is not  adequate enough. WSPs could invest in ensuring ASL and LSQ users receive services in their   native language. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 974483d3a5aed85d03cae2c8d20a22987b03bf5dc8e0fc6d0a04c19546ab24a1

Identifying the needs correctly is the most important task. Otherwise, there will still be   areas not well covered after the plan has been executed. - We also note that the CRTC has had to deal with internet, its applications, its incursion   in broadcasting, etc. So it knows that sending a digital stream that can replace TV   channels has value in the market. It also has to deal with telephony so the technical   criteria required to have decent voice services can be assessed. The CRTC can set the   standards, the target for basic services. - When a plan is executed, there needs to be an entity to track the progress and report   publicly: a watchdog. We think that the CRTC has most of the tools to track progress. It   is already doing it at a higher level. It also has reporting mechanisms. Tracking a lower   level plan like this one involves more detailed measuring instruments but it’s only one   small step.

Explain whether the underlying technology (e.g. The underlying technology ought not be considered a factor in defining whether a telecommunications service is the kind of basic service that is essential for participation in the digital economy. But different technologies have different capabilities with respect to the characteristics canvassed in question (b) of the Notice. For instance, a high-latency service like geostationary satellite may not be capable of supporting gaming, including educational gaming, or even certain voice services. What is more, different technologies have different levels of upgradability—some may require a wholesale refitting in order to achieve higher speeds; others may simply require that boxes be changed up at a fibre path’s ends Technology’s performance capabilities and its upgradability should certainly be considered in defining whether a telecommunications service is the kind of basic service that is essential for participation in the digital economy. c.	What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these prices be determined? Basic telecommunications services should be made available at just and reasonable rates: subsection () of the Act requires this, even if the Commission has the power to forebear from acting to enforce such rates. Where a competitive market in respect of a service functions to support such availability, then the market should decide that service’s rates. However, in many situations in which a competitive market does not exist, section  of the Act does not provide for the Commission to forbear from rate regulation. In such situations, we respectfully submit that the Commission should prefer wholesale to retail regulation. Q	Can market forces and government funding be relied on to ensure that all Canadians have access to basic telecommunications services?

Finally, the Commission need not retain the final two, PSTN-specific portions of the Basic Service Objective. Access to the long-distance network, operator/directory assistance services, enhanced calling and privacy protection features, emergency services, as well as voice message relay service, are important. But many of these services remain mandated as a component of providing voice services, and they are available from competing providers, over Internet service, which itself is available from competing providers over broadband. Going forward, the Commission may decide to mandate some of these services as a component of providing Internet services, or even as a component of providing broadband access. But it is achieving the Basic Service Objective that would let the Commission do so. Q	Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? TekSavvy respectfully notes that broadband access and Internet service are distinct from one another. Each of them is a basic telecommunications service, because each one offers a “pure transmission capability over a communications path that is virtually transparent in terms of its interaction with subscriber-supplied information”. [footnoteRef:]  The matter to be decided is which ought to be subsidized. [:  	Enhanced Services, Telecom Decision CRTC -,  July , II.C. (“A basic service should be limited to the offering of transmission capacity between two or more points suitable for a subscriber's transmission needs and subject only to the technical parameters of fidelity or distortion criteria, or other conditioning. Use internal to the service provider's facility of companding techniques, bandwidth compression techniques, circuit switching, message or packet switching, error control or other techniques that facilitate economical, reliable movement of information does not alter the nature of the basic service.”).

The benefit of such a rule change on growing competitors seeking a foothold in the market would far outweigh any harms. Second, the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear in  that, when ISPs do not select or originate programming or package programming services, they “merely provide the mode of transmission”, and provide a telecommunications service. [footnoteRef:]  It would appear that the “nature of these services, existing policies with respect to their contribution exempt status and administrative complications” has evolved. [footnoteRef:]   [:  	Reference re Broadcasting Act, []  S.C.R. ]  [:  	Decision CRTC -, paragraph .] Q	Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications services be subsidized? It is, in TekSavvy’s respectful submission, clear that not all services considered to be basic telecommunications services can be subsidized. In our responses to questions  and , we have proposed that broadband access service be the basic service that is subsidized. In our response to question , below, we describe discoverability and market regulation measures that ought to be reviewed and put into place prior to subsidizing transport services. The circumstances under which broadband access should be subsidized are similar to those now in place.

Furthermore, in all  workably competitive markets in Canada, the Commission should abstain from price  regulation whether in the form of tariffs or price caps, including for those  telecommunications services that the Commission determines should be considered  as basic for all Canadians. The only obligation to be placed on TSPs generally for broadband Internet  access services and basic voice service should be that such access be provided  without unfair discrimination or undue preference to customers requesting such  services where facilities are available. In short, the telecommunications services that        July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                may be considered by the Commission as most important to support Canadians’  telecommunications needs generally should be basic voice and broadband Internet  access services provided by the TSP of their choice. The Commission’s primary role and responsibility with regard to the  availability of basic telecommunications service and the achievement of its target  broadband service speeds is to monitor whether target broadband Internet access  services and basic voice service are being deployed to all Canadians in a reasonable  and timely fashion and, if needed, to take appropriate measures. In this regard,  Cogeco submits that the regulatory approach established through the policy  determinations made by the Commission in TRP -, consistent with the  statutory telecommunications policy objectives and the government’s Policy Direction,  remains fully appropriate, relevant and sufficient.  July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                GENERAL COMMENTS    . Cogeco is pleased to file this intervention in the matter of the Commission’s   telecommunications regulatory proceeding initiated by Telecom Notice of   Consultation (TNC) CRTC -. Cogeco welcomes the opportunity to participate   fully in this proceeding and requests the opportunity to appear at the public hearing   scheduled to begin on April , . Cogeco commends the Commission for initiating this important proceeding   with a view to assessing the present state of basic telecommunications services   offered to Canadians across Canada, the needs that these services fulfill presently   and are expected to fulfill in the future, as well as the prospects for the future   development and extension of these services throughout the country. As evidenced by the Commission’s annual communications monitoring reports,   the Canadian telecommunications industry and the services that it provides to   Canadians are evolving rapidly due to technological change and a highly dynamic   and competitive market environment. As a result, Canadian consumers now enjoy more choice than ever before in   telecommunications services, the telecommunications service providers that offer   them, and the range and pricing of competitive service offerings available to them.

In keeping with the federal government’s Policy Direction, the Commission   should not however attempt to preempt or replace technological change, competitive   market forces and targeted government funding programs with a view to   implementing uniform basic telecommunications service objectives through ex ante   regulatory intervention, including through mandated cross-subsidization schemes. RESPONSE TO THE COMMISSION’S QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    Canadians’ evolving needs for telecommunications services     . Canadians are using telecommunications services to fulfill many social,   economic, and cultural needs in today’s digital economy.  July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                  a) Explain how telecommunications services are used to meet these   needs. the online  purchase and trade of products or services), e-banking and/or  telephone banking, e-health or telehealth services, telework, and  distance education. Which of these uses of telecommunications  services are the most important to ensure that Canadians  meaningfully participate in the digital economy? Telecommunications services are used by Canadians for a very wide range of   personal, business, institutional and other needs, including but not limited to e-  commerce, e-banking, e-health, telework and distance education. For example,   telecommunications services are also used for general Internet surfing, chatting,   gaming, gambling and movie and other entertainment content downloading. Also, telecommunications services are accessed by Canadians over a wide   variety of technologies, platforms and devices and are used by Canadians over a very   wide range of service configurations and packages, including mixed packages of   telecommunications, broadcasting, software and hardware products and services. The importance and perceived value of each available individual   telecommunications service varies from one customer to the other, based on the   customer’s own individual preferences and circumstances. Cogeco respectfully submits that it is neither possible nor appropriate for the   Commission to attempt to define what would constitute “meaningful participation” in   the “digital economy” in relation to any particular use of any specific   telecommunications service or package of telecommunications services.

July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                   . The telecommunications services that may be considered by the Commission   as most important to support Canadians’ basic telecommunications needs should be   voice and broadband Internet access services provided by the TSP of their choice. The evolution of telecommunications technology over various transmission   protocols and platforms, as well as competitive market dynamics, are driving on an   on-going basis the appropriate parameters for specific telecommunications services,   including but not limited to capacity, mobility, speed and latency. In the highly dynamic competitive market environment for telecommunications   services in Canada, changes to these service parameters occur rapidly, efficiently   and seamlessly in a way that cannot be matched or replaced by ex ante regulatory   intervention. c) Identify and explain the barriers that limit or prevent Canadians from   meaningfully participating in the digital economy (e.g. availability,  quality, price, digital literacy, and concerns related to privacy and  security).

Additionally, it cannot be ignored that over  percent of Canadian households   will be able to subscribe to high-speed Internet at minimum speeds of  Mbps based   on different technologies by  as a result of the recent government funding   initiative, namely the Connecting Canadians program. In light of this context and taking into account the current trend, Cogeco   believes that broadband Internet access service speeds of  Mbps download and    Mbps upload (/ Mbps) could be reasonably set by the Commission as its revised                                                        In the news releases recently issued by Industry Canada announcing the subsidies allowed by the   Government of Canada to different projects aiming to bring high-speed Internet to underserved and  unserved areas across the country, it is repeatedly stated that “By Canada’s   th  birthday in ,   over  percent of Canadian households will be able to subscribe to new or improved high-speed  Internet services”.

Cogeco submits that such revised target speeds would not only be consistent   with baseline speeds targeted in other jurisdictions but also enable Canadians to   meet their basic needs with respect to their use of broadband Internet access service   over the next five years. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services     . Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic   telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to  meaningfully participate in the digital economy? As indicated in our answer to question  b) above, the telecommunications   services that may be considered by the Commission as most important to support   Canadians’ telecommunications needs generally should be basic voice and   broadband Internet access services provided by the TSP of their choice. Cogeco submits that basic voice and broadband Internet access services   enable all basic voice, data and other telecommunications needs in the digital world. cable, digital subscriber   line, fibre, fixed wireless, mobile wireless, and satellite technology)  should be a factor in defining whether a telecommunications service  should be considered a basic service. In keeping with the Canadian telecommunications policy and the federal   government’s Policy Direction, the Commission’s regulatory framework, including with                                                        For example, the FCC recently adopted a new minimum speed standard of  Mbps downstream and    Mbps upstream (/ Mbps), previously set at / Mbps, for recipients of high-cost universal service  support.

Technological neutrality is also supported by the fact that many TSPs,   including the Incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), currently use or have   access to a variety of technological platforms, and that they have both the opportunity   and the incentive to decide on the most appropriate configuration of technologies and   platforms to deliver their telecommunications services to Canadians while meeting   standard, technologically agnostic, basic regulatory requirements. b) Identify, with supporting rationale, the terms, conditions, and service   characteristics under which basic telecommunications services should  be provided. Should any obligations be placed on the provider(s) of these  services? The only obligation to be placed on TSPs generally for basic voice and   broadband Internet access services should be that such access be provided without   any unfair discrimination or undue preference to customers requesting such services   where facilities are available and subject to the fulfillment by the customer of the   TSP’s standard terms of service and the payment of the applicable charges and fees   published by the TSP for such services. Cogeco submits that this standard basic service obligation should apply   across the board to all TSPs irrespective of the particular technology or combination   of technologies used by the TSP. c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and   how should these prices be determined? Provide rationale to support  your answer.  July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                . The federal government’s Policy Direction provides the underlying principles   that should govern regulatory intervention by the Commission, including on pricing for   basic telecommunications services. Specifically, Section  a) i) of the Policy Direction   clearly states that the Commission should “rely on market forces to the maximum   extent feasible as the means of achieving the telecommunications policy objectives”. Therefore, in all workably competitive markets in Canada, in furtherance of the   statutory telecommunications policy objective respecting the promotion of   competition, and as determined in accordance with the criteria set in the Policy   Direction, Cogeco submits that the Commission should abstain from price regulation   whether in the form of tariffs or price caps, including for those telecommunications   services that the Commission determines should be considered as basic for all   Canadians. What are  the roles of the private sector and the various levels of government  (federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal) in ensuring that investment  in telecommunications infrastructure results in the availability of modern  telecommunications services to all Canadians? The fundamental principle underlying the federal government’s Policy Direction   is reliance on market forces to the maximum extent feasible. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER ccc2e7b2c4326684ad4a9a9916f3eafbb93b1a40a86ebe3a5372710e8f024a87
  Objective (f) of the Canadian telecommunications policy states as follows:  “to foster   increased reliance on market forces for the provision of telecommunications services and to   ensure that regulation, where required, is efficient and effective”        July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                . The Commission’s primary role and responsibility is to ensure that all   telecommunications markets in Canada are and remain workably competitive rather   than to intervene in workably competitive markets through price reregulation or other   forms of ex ante regulation. Governments, whether at the federal, provincial, territorial or municipal level,   may elect to implement, or continue to implement, public funding programs in the   public interest with a view to achieving the deployment of baseline   telecommunications infrastructure and/or services in those markets where   uneconomic conditions actually preclude the attainment of this objective. In this   regard, we note that the federal government currently has in place such a program. The role of TSPs in the private sector is to compete vigorously in the offering of   all telecommunications services and the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure   and facilities. What should be the Commission’s role in ensuring the availability of   basic telecommunications services to all Canadians? What action, if any,  should the Commission take where Canadians do not have access to  telecommunications services that are considered to be basic services? In Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC - (“TRP -”) issued on    May , following an extensive public proceeding on the obligation to serve and   other related matters, the Commission made a number of important policy   determinations consistent with the statutory policy objectives for telecommunications   in the Telecommunications Act and the federal government’s Policy Direction. In paragraph  of TRP -, the Commission stated that these   regulatory measures “… are efficient and proportionate to their purpose, and   minimally interfere with market forces”, noted in this regard its determinations “… with        July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                respect to reducing reliance on subsidies, eliminating the application of the basic   service objective in forborne exchanges, and providing ILECs with the flexibility to   achieve their obligation to serve by using the technology of their choice”, and further   specifically noted its determination that “… regulatory intervention is not appropriate   at this time with respect to the matter of access to broadband and that market forces   should continue to be relied upon”. In the absence of clear widespread market failure, Cogeco submits that these   explicit policy determinations remain fully appropriate, relevant and sufficient. The Commission should continue to monitor on an on-going basis the actual   improvements to the availability of basic voice and broadband Internet access   services and the achievement of its target speeds for broadband Internet access   service throughout Canada. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER ccc2e7b2c4326684ad4a9a9916f3eafbb93b1a40a86ebe3a5372710e8f024a87
b) What impact would the establishment of such a mechanism have on   private sector investment and government programs to fund the  provision of modern telecommunications services? As mentioned in paragraph  above in our answer to question , Cogeco   submits that the Commission’s policy determinations in TRP - remain fully   appropriate, relevant and sufficient. In the absence of a clear model for the operation, funding and implementation   timetable for such new or additional cross-subsidization measures, and to which   basket of services they would apply, it is not possible to assess precisely the resulting        July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                impact on private sector investment and government programs to fund modern   telecommunications services mechanism in the operating territory involved. It is however possible to state with confidence that such new or additional   mandated cross-subsidization measures for the benefit of the incumbent monopoly   carrier in Northwestel’s operating territory would likely prevent mixed public and   private competitive initiatives from taking hold or extending further. It is also possible to state with confidence that the design and implementation   of such new or additional cross-subsidization measures would inevitably involve   daunting challenges as well as a substantial regulatory burden on the Commission   and industry participants. Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services      What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the   basic service objective? Cogeco submits that there is no compelling reason for changing or varying the   obligation to serve and the basic service objective in non-forborne exchanges as   determined in TRP -. Further, there is no need to apply additional ex ante regulatory requirements to   all TSPs across the board for an obligation to serve or the extension of the basic   service objective to a broadband Internet access service.   Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic   telecommunications service? What other services, if any, should be  defined as basic telecommunications services? Please refer to our answer to question  b) above.  July       Review of basic telecommunications services   Cogeco Intervention – TNC CRTC  -   Page  of                   What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service   subsidy regime? What resulting changes, if any, would be required to the  existing regulatory frameworks (e.g. As determined in TRP -, the existing local service subsidy regime   should be maintained for the benefit of the few remaining non-forborne local   exchanges in the high-cost service areas until they become workably competitive. However, any proposed changes submitted in the current proceeding that would   contribute to reduce or even eliminate reliance on such subsidies should be   considered by the Commission. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER ccc2e7b2c4326684ad4a9a9916f3eafbb93b1a40a86ebe3a5372710e8f024a87
However, any proposed changes submitted in the current proceeding that would   contribute to reduce or even eliminate reliance on such subsidies should be   considered by the Commission. An extension of the existing local service subsidy regime to broadband Internet   services, or its replacement by a new regime that would extend to broadband Internet   services, would be highly problematic for the same reasons that led the Commission   not to do so in TRP -.  What changes, if any, should be made to the contribution collection   mechanism? Your response should address, with supporting rationale,  which TSPs should be required to contribute to the NCF, which revenues  should be contribution-eligible and which revenues, if any, should be  excluded from the calculation of contribution-eligible revenues. Cogeco submits that there is no reason to consider implementing at this time   any changes to the National Contribution Fund (NCF).  Should some or all services that are considered to be basic   telecommunications services be subsidized? Explain, with supporting  details, which services should be subsidized and under what  circumstances. Cogeco submits that, consistent with the statutory telecommunications policy   objectives and the federal government’s Policy Direction, the Commission should   refrain from establishing a new or expanded cross-subsidization mechanism that   would extend to broadband Internet or other telecommunications services. The establishment of a cross-subsidization mechanism for broadband Internet   services would be highly problematic and could not be implemented in a   technologically and competitively neutral fashion. In addition, such a regime would   have a deleterious effect on the investment by the private sector of the   telecommunications industry in the upgrading and extension of broadband   telecommunications facilities.  If there is a need to establish a new funding mechanism to support the   provision of modern telecommunications services, describe how this  mechanism would operate.

Given findings across a spectrum of research  programs, I sought to highlight the persisting divides in ways that  Canadians access and use telecommunications services,  specifically digital connections. While not all Canadians enjoy  sufficient access to reliable digital infrastructure such as broadband  Internet, the larger argument made in the Phase  submission was  that mere access to digital connectivity is insufficient to meet the  broader policy objectives of economic growth and citizen  engagement. In this intervention submitted in Phase , I return to Section II of  the Phase  submission, to clarify a number of points made about  the Commission’s role regarding access to basic  telecommunications services. This clarification takes shape around  the definition of basic telecommunications services and status of  market forces in relation to certain cited interventions made by  other parties in Phase . Updated: Response to the specific consultation objectives     II. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications  services    Definition of basic services     . As is evident across the hundreds of interventions in Phase , the  definition of “basic” services remains unclear. Articulating a more  robust definition of what basic means is the first fundamental  problem that this proceeding must address as it moves forward  into the hearings. Despite the lack of clarity around what specific parameters  constitute basic telecommunications services, there is some  agreement among intervenors that broadband and satellite  Internet, along with wireless and wireline telephony, should be  included. While including these different types of connectivity  raises distinct sets of questions about infrastructural development  according to the contingencies of each technology, it is important  to maintain this plurality of communications channels in order to  acknowledge the different meanings of “basic” across sectors of  the Canadian population. The question of basic services is often         less about the specific technologies over which telecommunications  services are delivered and more about the reliability, affordability,  and quality of the connection.

Moreover, as the Phase  submission by Cybera points out, these  barriers tend to exacerbate the existing divides between urban and  rural Canadians.     . Almost all of the submissions have noted that more ambitious  targets must be set for broadband Internet speeds. The Phase   submission by Rob McMahon of the First Mile Connectivity  Consortium deftly summarizes the deficiencies in current speed  targets, particularly in Northern Canada. As noted in this and  other submissions, target speeds should match those set  internationally in similar developed countries such as the US and  Australia and those across Western Europe. Since the issue of  connection quality is ever-evolving along with technological                                                     Tamara Shepherd (), CRTC Telecom Notice of Consultation -, Review of basic  telecommunications services,  July.

Similar to the definition problem underlying the goal of ensuring  basic telecommunication service, the definition of “market forces”  requires additional clarification.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Phase  submissions made by the  larger telecommunications providers all describe the robust health  of current market forces. Telus’s submission states that “the  market is working very well to provide basic telecommunications  services to the vast majority of Canadians,” and Rogers’s  submission asserts that “Competition is Constantly Pushing ISPs to  Improve.” Moreover, Bell included in its intervention documents a  specially commissioned independent report on competition in the  Canadian telecoms sector, which finds that “the market is  characterized by vigorous, dynamic competition, with multiple  firms deploying different types of infrastructures and technologies  to produce rapidly improving levels of service.”     . The arguments made by large firms about the competitive nature  of the market are not, however, matched by equivalent statements  by newer entrants. For example, WIND Mobile’s submission states  that “the evidence clearly establishes that even with hundreds of  millions of dollars of Government funding and the operation of  market forces, the current broadband target is clearly a very costly  and difficult goal, particularly as one seeks to expand  telecommunications networks further and further into the remote                                                     Monica Auer (), Forum for Research and Policy in Communications (FRPC), Comments  on Telecom Notices of Consultation CRTC - and --, Review of basic  telecommunications services,  July.

Further, submissions from intervenors not representing industry  positions tend to be even more reserved about the capacity for  market forces to ensure the provision of basic telecommunications  services. Consider the Phase  submission made by Beverly  Milligan of Media Access Canada, which describes a Canadian  broadband market characterized by high prices and low service  quality that has not fulfilled the promise of providing basic service,  particularly for Canadians with disabilities. Vaxination  Informatique’s submission portrays a telecom industry in Canada  that “has become addicted to subsidies, so they lack initiative,  preferring to wait for subsidies or being forced by the Commission  to act.

There is evidently a need for better compilation of the patchwork  of data around basic services, as presented across the  interventions. For example, the potential of the Internet  Performance Test as a new tool for measuring speeds, introduced  in the Phase  submission of Fenwick McKelvey, could be cross- referenced with data on speeds from the Communications  Monitoring Report, as well as data about usage from the  Canadian Internet Use Survey. The CRTC’s support for the  gathering and publication of increasingly robust sets of data that  are internationally comparable is also something suggested across  many of the Phase  interventions that is important to emphasize  again here. The idea behind increasing the availability and utility of public data  that can inform a proceeding such as this one is further meant to  drill down into the specifics of what exactly is under regulatory  consideration. Policy strategies need to be sensitive to the  multiple, situated ways of defining the digital divide and its  impacts in order to effectuate beneficial changes in internet  adoption and usage, as noted in the Phase  submission from  MediaSmarts.     . The concept of basic telecommunications services, while crucial for   the Commission to consider as part of its regulatory  responsibilities, can only ever constitute one part of the                                                     Fenwick McKelvey (), Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -, Review of basic  telecommunications services,  July.

In fact, the  Communications Monitoring Report recognizes that consumers rely   on multiple services per household, including wireline telephone, internet, wireless and TV   distribution (noting that the average number of communications connections per Canadian   household increased from . in  to . in )     . These technologies are increasingly used   for applications that go well beyond fulfilling basic telecom needs – including for entertainment,   social networking, streaming TV and programming content. Eastlink submits it is relevant to   consider that it is much of this non-essential use that is driving capacity needs, when assessing   whether the Commission should change the basic service objective (BSO) requirements. In this proceeding the Commission has sought answers to a number of questions (the   Questions) listed in the Notice. We offer our general thoughts below, along with initial answers   to some of the Questions, attached. Basic Service Objective       . While reserving the right to provide further comments at a later date, Eastlink submits   that the existing BSO requirements for basic wireline telephone service likely do not require   material changes. A wireline telephone network, once built, can readily serve consumers and   usage does not generally impact the capacity of the network; in our view, the existing rules in   place associated with mandating a basic standalone telephone line, seem to be reasonable. We   also note that while the BSO includes the provision of individual telephone line service, the   ILECs obligation to serve (OTS) can be met by offering mobile wireless voice service. As described in TRP -, “the primary goal of the obligation to serve and the basic   service objective is for all Canadians, regardless of where they reside, to have reasonable access                                                              Communications Monitoring Report, page .      to basic telecommunications services”.       If this goal remains valid, a key issue is to determine   what “basic telecommunications services” are today. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 2c64d81ff21ca0e85a8374cb2bc0e2c9fce19a771fedc5a57d36a667e4d307a7
In Eastlink’s view, it would be  extremely difficult, if not impossible, to build internet access to Canadians in high cost serving  areas based on “uses consumers should reasonably expect to make” – because use is constantly  expanding and the types of use play a significant role in increasing capacity constraints, at least  in Eastlink’s experience. We refer again to our example of the Rural Connect service in Nova  Scotia. In many of the unserved and underserved communities it is not feasible to build a service  that will fulfill the expected uses by consumers in those areas, either now or over the course of  the next  or  years. Even if the Commission determines that a minimum capacity to fulfil          basic needs should be the target, we cannot control what a consumer will do when they turn their  internet connection on. As to timelines, please refer to Eastlink’s response to Question . The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services      . Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic telecommunications  services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital  economy? cable, digital subscriber line, fibre, fixed  wireless, mobile wireless, and satellite technology) should be a factor in defining whether a  telecommunications service should be considered a basic service. b) Identify, with supporting rationale, the terms, conditions, and service characteristics  under which basic telecommunications services should be provided. Should any obligations  be placed on the provider(s) of these services? If so, what obligations and on which service  provider(s)? c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these  prices be determined? (a-c) Basic telecom services necessary for Canadians to meaningfully participate in the digital  economy are not likely that different from those the Commission determined in , noting also  the objective of a /Mbps service. Eastlink does not necessarily believe that the technology  should be a factor in defining whether the service is basic – rather, it should be whether the  service is available to the consumer and meets the basic telecommunications requirement. However, we acknowledge that services provided over certain technologies will have inherent  capacity limitations and if the objective is long term sustainable service for those areas, then  technology becomes a relevant factor toward ensuring this objective is met. Given the impact that internet usage has on costs to maintain the service and given that most  areas that are underserved or unserved are challenging and costly areas to serve, a regulated  requirement to serve these areas may not be an appropriate solution. In any regime that mandates  the provision of the service it is important to recognize the need for reasonable cost recovery and  markup.

We refer to our submission that even in cases of underserved areas today, over time some of  these areas can justify expansion through government funding or private investment. Eastlink has  recently expanded service to another - homes in a currently underserved area of Nova  Scotia with our own investment. We would have serious concerns if a mandatory regime granted  funding or subsidies to our much larger competitors after we have been making our own  significant investments into many of these rural areas. A mechanism as proposed for  Northwestel’s territory will mean that all Canadians, through industry subsidies, will be  subsidizing these communities – such a model, if expanded to other regions would mean  increased costs for all Canadians. The nature of the expansion is also relevant – mandating a build out that would have short term  benefits and result in consumer dissatisfaction is not the right course of action; rather than target  all such areas over a shorter timeframe with an unsustainable, low capacity service, perhaps  targeting fewer areas for incremental build outs of a higher quality service would be preferable. Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services      . What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service  objective? Eastlink sees no reason to make material changes to the existing OTS and BSO, other than to  remove the requirement to provide a printed phone book.

We reserve the right to comment at a later stage of this proceeding. Your  response should address, with supporting rationale, which TSPs should be required to  contribute to the NCF, which revenues should be contribution-eligible and which revenues,  if any, should be excluded from the calculation of contribution-eligible revenues. Eastlink reserves the right to comment at a later phase of this proceeding. Generally Eastlink  supports principles of competitive fairness in such determinations and a determination about who  should contribute would more appropriately be made as this proceeding progresses and there is  more clarity on the extent of changes to the BSO and the outcome of whether broadband is  included. It may be that a broader base of revenues and TSPs should be included in the event of  such changes. Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications services  be subsidized? Explain, with supporting details, which services should be subsidized and  under what circumstances. No, as per Eastlink’s submission and our answers to the questions above, Eastlink has concerns  about a subsidized regime for new services that form the BSO. If subsidies do form part of a  new BSO regime, they should only be established to the very limited extent necessary. This may  involve a reconsideration of existing policies on costing in HCSAs and permitting service  providers more flexibility in charges for services. Expanding subsidies only means more  Canadians will be paying more for their communications services. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 2c64d81ff21ca0e85a8374cb2bc0e2c9fce19a771fedc5a57d36a667e4d307a7

Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services   The Commission’s role in ensuring access to basic telecommunications services   . The CRTC’s basic service objective does not currently include high-speed broadband Internet access,  and instead is limited to the capability to connect via low-speed data transmission. Given the  persistent lag in bringing high-speed broadband to rural and remote areas, and the challenges of  relying on targeted government funding and market forces, the Commission should update the basic  service objective to include broadband at an internationally-comparable and evolving speed target. The basic service objective would need to guarantee long-term, reliable connectivity at affordable  prices for all communities. The Commission should ensure broadband networks can accommodate  rapid technological change and have redundant connections to prevent gaps in essential  communication services. The Commission should also prioritize establishing service parity between  northern and southern communities. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER b8d0db796ec28185679d7d42bb885a27771509b53529ab89776ecf6e30f4dee1

We also wish to recognize the unique challenges faced by the Commission in this consultation. An extensive array of interventions has been filed with a broad range of comments and perspectives. While the range of proposed solutions (e.g. subsidies for low income individuals and households,[footnoteRef:] structural separation of backbone infrastructure,[footnoteRef:] and new funding mechanisms for lower levels of government[footnoteRef:]) is broad, there is a clear expression from numerous groups and individuals that broadband should be considered a basic telecommunication service, access should be universal, and the range of digital divides (access, affordability, skills/digital literacy) need to be addressed for the Canadian economy and society in general to thrive in the st century. [:   For example see: Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation.

[:   For example see: Eastern Ontario Wardens’ Caucus/Eastern Ontario Regional Network (EOWC/EORN). Intervention Regarding CRTC Review of Basic Telecommunication Services. In this regard, we wish to reiterate that regardless of the approach adopted by the CRTC, special consideration should be paid to Canadians that are disadvantaged by various digital divides, including but not limited to, rural and remote Canadians, Canadians from lower income groups, Canadians with low or limited digital skills/literacy, linguistic minorities, and other socially and economically marginalized and disadvantaged groups. [footnoteRef:]  [:   McNally et al. Intervention in Response to… -. para. Details of the Utility Model and Proposed Fund  . Our model is comprised of four elements: facilitating access to transport/backbone facilities; subsidies to incent and ensure broadband penetration for rural and remote communities and individuals; mechanisms to ensure affordable access for low income individuals; and, funding for skills development/digital literacy.

An alternative mechanism for ensuring affordable access for low income Canadians is the imposition of price caps. The Commission has previously demonstrated a willingness to engage retail price regulation to ensure it meets it policy objectives. It established a $ per month price cap for basic television services in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC -. [footnoteRef:]  Similarly in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC - the Commission adopted price cap regulation noting, “[t]he Commission considers that price cap regulation… will provide sufficient regulatory oversight to ensure that consumers benefit from the regulatory framework.”[footnoteRef:] [:   CRTC. Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC -. http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive//-.htm para. Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -, para. At this time and with existing information we are unable to identify the exact amount for a price cap for basic telecommunications services. However, as noted in our intervention we suggest that a useful starting point for considering a price cap would be to examine average household expenditures and incomes. [footnoteRef:]  In our intervention we noted that the average household expenditure for other utilities is roughly % of household expenditures (which also happens to be roughly % of median income and average income after tax by families). Finally, the new model should also include funding for skills development/digital literacy. While Employment and Skills Development Canada and provincial/territorial education ministries (and the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada) should be involved in the promotion of digital literacy as an essential skill for Canadians, we recognize that with regard to this consultation any such funds would have to be dispersed solely by the Commission. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 43689ee383c3337c1d0104fcc1be6788ad37f911fe7a030bbe99cb95904156c1
Funding for skills/digital literacy should be viewed as an integral part of basic telecommunications services. Furthermore, investing in skills/digital literacy should have the added benefit of increasing technical capacity in communities, which should make it easier for all telecommunication service providers to find qualified individuals to provide operation support for broadband networks thus decreasing operational costs. Skills development and digital literacy should also include educational initiatives emanating from the Commission for local governments to enhance local governments understanding of broadband and local broadband policymaking capacity. The CRTC should also fund independent research to evaluate broadband policy and regulatory models. These funds should include a component for international comparisons aimed at identifying critical success factors that other jurisdictions have adopted to encourage the deployment of affordable broadband and enhance digital literacy. D. Network Access by Internet Service Providers  . Backbone infrastructure will be available on an open access model. This approach also supports the mandated disaggregated wholesale high-speed access services approach undertaken in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -. Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -]    [bookmark: _GoBack]Concluding Remarks  . As noted in paragraph  of this response to the interrogatory, this approach is to serve as a conceptual model. As indicated there are numerous broader policy considerations that could be implemented that would achieve the desired goal of eliminating digital divides (access, affordability, skills) more effectively; however, we recognize the limitations faced by the Commission.

Canada’s unusual characteristics – large country, small  population – make it likely that regulatory intervention  and support will be needed to ensure the affordability  and availability of basic Internet services.

How access to basic service is ensured? Can market forces and government funding be relied on  to  ensure  that  all  Canadians  have  access  to  basic  telecommunications services?

Market forces cannot be relied on to ensure that the   million people living in Canada have access to basic  telecommunications services because such forces only  operate properly when competition is unlimited.

 The establishment of a capital infrastructure mechanism is unlikely to have any  immediate impact on private sector investment in modern telecommunications services  in areas that are now underserved and require such services.

The CRTC should include affordable and reliable payphone and high‐speed  telecommunications services in rural and urban areas as part of the basic service  objective.  The CRTC should not discontinue basic service obligations for landline services, as long as  the majority of Canada’s population continues to use, if not rely on, these services.   Define broadband and other services as basic service   Should  broadband  Internet  service  be  defined  as  a  basic  telecommunications  service?

Yes – affordable and reliable broadband Internet service should be defined as a basic  telecommunications service in Canada.  We note that the government of the United Kingdom announced this past March that  broadband would be made a basic legal right.  The proposals would ensure broadband  speeds of at least  megabits per second, and include plans for a minimum broadband  speed of  megabits per second across the nation.  Research there purports to  suggest that  megabits per second would be optimum, because the growing                                                              Juliette Garside, “Broadband to be basic legal right, says George Osborne” The Guardian (  March ), online:  http://www.theguardian.com/technology//mar//broadband‐to‐be‐basic‐ legal‐right‐says‐george‐osborne. http://www.theguardian.com/technology//mar//broadband-to-be-basic-legal-right-says-george-osborne http://www.theguardian.com/technology//mar//broadband-to-be-basic-legal-right-says-george-osborne   Forum for Research and Policy in Communications (FRPC)   Basic service obligations TNoC ‐  Comments ( July ) Page       availability of devices connected to the internet within households means that two or  more people are using high bandwidth services at the same time.    We therefore suggest that the basic service obligation include  Mbs to the home by  .  Basic telecommunications should also include local payphones and  emergency  services, which should be available from coast to coast to coast.  Local payphones must be part of the basic obligation to serve because they ensure  access to the telecommunications system for people who    do not have any telecommunications services    do not have mobile telecommunications service    cannot use their wireline or wireless services due to emergencies, or who    are visiting Canada, its provinces or its territories and do not otherwise have  access to Canadian wireline or wireless telecommunications service.

To return to Digital Canada , its key provision to address in light of the research discussed is the connection between basic telecommunications infrastructure and Canadians’ digital participation. One shortcoming of the strategy is in its instrumental focus on digital skills training for workers and innovation in the digital technologies sector. Instead, we suggest a broader scope for policy objectives around increasing Canadians’ participation in the digital economy. This broader scope would situate economic participation as part of everyday social life, and digital connectivity as one avenue for participation among others. This is to say that any public discussion on attempting to measure and set standards for what should be considered basic service must situate economic participation through the internet within a more holistic approach to access that accounts for both supply side and demand side barriers. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services  Definition of basic services  . At its core, the concept of basic service suggests that digital connectivity – as a central part of contemporary telecommunications – be viewed as a kind of utility, much like electricity or water. [footnoteRef:] As a utility, digital connectivity is not framed as a choice and thus requires regulation in order to help provide access especially to less advantaged or profitable segments of the Canadian population. Our research concurs with this viewpoint for the most part, in that the CIUS suggests that an overwhelming majority of Canadians (.% as of ) do not view internet connectivity as a choice. [footnoteRef:]  [:  Principal Researcher danah boyd of Microsoft Research in the US has suggested a similar approach to particular internet platforms such as Facebook, where she argues for its regulation as a social utility, stating: “Don’t forget: we spent how many years being told that the Internet wasn’t a utility, wasn’t a necessity… now we’re spending what kind of money trying to get universal broadband out there without pissing off the monopolistic beasts because we like to pretend that choice and utility can sit easily together.” See: http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives////facebook-is-a-utility-utilities-get-regulated.html]  [:  Statistics Canada, The Canadian Internet Use Survey , The Daily: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien//dqd-eng.htm]    . Regulatory parameters for digital connectivity thus need to ensure a sufficient scope of network infrastructure (especially for rural and remote areas) and quality of service.

, Cogeco believes that both voice services and broadband Internet access services are essential to Canadians being able to meaningful participate in the digital economy. Answer:  Cogeco is still of the view that both voice and broadband Internet access services, provided by the telecommunications service provider of their choice, should continue to be the foundation for meaningful participation by Canadians in the digital economy. Cogeco(AAC)Aug-   Please refer to para.  of Cogeco’s first intervention ( July ), which states: “Telecommunications services are used by Canadians for a very wide range of personal, business, institutional and other needs, including but not limited to e-commerce, e-banking, e-health, telework and distance education.”   Please refer to para.  of Cogeco’s intervention, which states that “there is no need to apply additional ex ante regulatory requirements to all TSPs across the board for an obligation to serve or the extension of the basic service objective to a broadband Internet access service.”   A) Please confirm whether or not Cogeco believes that the telecommunications services referenced in para.  require broadband Internet access services.

B) Does Cogeco support the AAC’s position regarding the existing local service subsidy regime, in paras. Answer:  The complete reference at paragraph  is the following:  As determined in TRP -, the existing local service subsidy regime should be maintained for the benefit of the few remaining non-forborne local exchanges in the high-cost service areas until they become workably competitive. However, any proposed changes submitted in the current proceeding that would contribute to reduce or even eliminate reliance on such subsidies should be considered by the Commission.

This intervention is filed by Rogers Communications Partnership (Rogers) pursuant to the procedures set forth in Telecom Notice of Consultation -, Review of basic telecommunications services (“TNC -”). In TNC  – , the Commission asks whether its definition of basic service and its basic service obligation should be modified, whether broadband Internet access should be considered a basic service, and whether the contribution regime should be modified to support the extension of broadband access to unserved and underserved areas. It is Self-evident that Broadband Internet Service is a Basic Service . It is self-evident to Rogers that broadband Internet service is a basic telecom service that should be available to all Canadians. It is used by Canadians to communicate either using email, VoIP or other services and millions of Canadians use it to access social media. Moreover, use continues to expand with Canadians using ever increasing numbers of apps and consuming ever larger quantities of data. High-speed broadband Internet access is a necessary prerequisite for Canadians to participate in the digital economy in a meaningful way and almost all Canadians now have access to this important service. In the words of the Canadian telecommunications policy statement in section  of the Telecommunications Act, high-speed broadband Internet access has become an essential enabler for the social and economic fabric of Canada. While Rogers believes that the vast majority of Canadians now have access to this service, it acknowledges that there may be some percentage of the population that still does not have access to a service that qualifies as high-speed.

In considering this issue, regard must be had to the subsidy programs administered by the the federal government under its Economic Action Plan for Canada, pursuant to which contracts have been awarded to extend the reach of high-speed Internet access over the next two years. Regards must also be had to the activities of the many competitive suppliers of high-speed Internet access, who are constantly extending and upgrading the quality of their services. As well, exciting new developments involving satellite, drone and balloon technology initiatives aimed at delivery of lower cost broadband service by several of the largest tech companies in the world also hold great promise. Consideration must also be given to the fact that the level of basic service that should be available to Canadians is not static. It must respond to their social and economic requirements which evolve over time. By way of example, in the  Review of Basic Services, the Commission included Internet access in the basic service definition for the first time. It set the required speed at the level required for dial-up Internet access –  Kbps. At the same time, the Commission set a target of  Mbps downstream and  Mbps upstream as the objective to achieve over the next five years. Basic Service Standard of  Mbps Downstream and  Mbps Upstream . A basic service standard of / Mbps is consistent with the evolution in the market as well as the Government’s current service level to which service providers must commit to be eligible for funding. It was used as the standard in the Government’s most recent funding initiative in . OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3f46e28892ed66d70f7ca0285acfec090e21e701ab4c3cc2f2aeb3ff0711a033
Regulatory Reform in an Era of Total Convergence . High-speed Internet access provides the technology for total convergence - something consumers have been promised for many years. High-speed Internet connectivity at speeds of / Mbps, minimum, can support all of the functionality included in the current basic service objective, including voice communications, either as access-dependent or access-independent VoIP service. The updated basic service objective should explicitly recognize that the functionality currently provided by local and long distance telephone services can be provided over such a broadband Internet service, and allow for service providers to meet the basic service objective using this connection. Rogers submits that once full access to high-speed broadband is achieved, the Commission can transition away from its current regulatory model which is centred on the provision of dial-tone as the foundation for basic service, towards a new world where Internet connectivity is the foundation, and expect voice communications will be available wherever broadband access is available. Ultimately, no service other than high-speed Internet connectivity needs to be defined as basic telecommunications services. Rogers believes that the Commission should set this as an objective in the current proceeding and establish a transition period to achieve it within two years of concluding this proceeding. Should a subsidy regime be established for broadband service, it should not be limited to subsidizing the ILECs. An alternative mechanism would consider competitive bids, similar to the open approach used to award government funding. Competing for the subsidy should be open to all providers and the entity requiring the least subsidy from the fund would be selected as the winning bidder. In addition, consideration should be given to funding just backhaul transport facilities on a location-by-location basis.

[bookmark: _Toc][bookmark: _Toc]..   No Obligation to Serve is required Rogers does not believe there should be an obligation to serve. Rogers submits that in almost all cases, the communications industry will chose to provide service in response to consumer demand and competitive market forces. Rogers submits that voice services included in the current basic service objective can be provided to any customer where there is a / Mbps high-speed Internet connection, either as access-dependent or access-independent VoIP service. The updated basic service objective should explicitly recognize that the functionality currently provided by local and long distance telephone services can be provided over such a broadband Internet service, and allow service providers to meet the basic service objective using this connection. Rogers submits that once full access to high-speed broadband is achieved, the Commission can transition away from its current regulatory model which is centred on the provision of dial-tone as the foundation for basic service, towards a new world where Internet connectivity is the foundation and voice communications will be available wherever there is broadband access. Ultimately, no other service needs to be defined as basic telecommunications services. An alternative mechanism would consider competitive bids, similar to the open approach used to award Government funding. For all the reasons above, Rogers submits that the contribution collection mechanism should be eliminated except for the funding of Video Relay Service (VRS) as ordered by the Commission in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -. Rogers Intervention TNC - Page  of   Rogers Intervention TNC - Page  of    [bookmark: _Toc]Appendix - Responses to Questions in Appendix B of TNC -   Canadians’ evolving needs for telecommunications services   .

This competitive technology and network dynamic is the foundation of Canada’s world-leading networks. e) As Canada’s digital economy continues to grow and evolve during the next  to  years, which telecommunications services are Canadians expected to need to participate meaningfully? As explained in our response to question  b), every service is important - wireline and wireless voice telephony and Internet services. World-leading networks will enable Canadian consumers and businesses to obtain the services they need and desire. [bookmark: _GoBack]As evidenced in the diagram provided in response to . b), a download speed of  Mbps permits high-definition video streaming at p and a host of less bandwidth demanding applications. Rogers submits that this speed is sufficient for the basic needs of Canadians. This speed will also support multiple simultaneous use of basic needs such as email, accessing government services, web-page browsing, audio streaming and standard definition video streaming. Rogers submits that / Mbps represents a minimum speed for the basic service objective, based on these considerations. Rogers notes that adopting a basic service objective that requires Internet connectivity to be provided at a minimum speed of / Mbps does not preclude the Commission from establishing a target goal for the future that aims for higher speed services. Canadians should have access to voice and Internet service. The underlying technology (e.g. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3f46e28892ed66d70f7ca0285acfec090e21e701ab4c3cc2f2aeb3ff0711a033
The Commission should continue regulating such items. Where forbearance has not been granted, the Commission should apply its regulatory processes and requirements to rates as it has historically. Such rate regulation has only applied to the ILECs and Rogers submits that this should continue to be the case. Assuming high-speed Internet is incorporated in the basic service objective, and thus mandated in higher cost locations, and it is determined that subsidies should be provided, the subsidy and any restrictions on the maximum price should bear in mind the higher costs of service. The customer should bear a reasonable portion of the higher cost before subsidies come into play. c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these prices be determined? Currently, the Commission has established a price ceiling of $ per month in high-cost serving areas for local telephone service. For purposes of calculating the subsidy, the Commission has estimated that providers receive an additional $ per month from optional services for total revenue of $ per month for a high-cost subscriber. The price ceiling and associated subsidies were based on detailed cost studies. As explained elsewhere, Rogers believes that local phone service subsidies should be eliminated. In the alternative, if the local telephone service subsidy structure remains in place, the subsidy should be redirected to broadband Internet service in line with its proposal for the basic service objective as discussed further in response to Question . OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3f46e28892ed66d70f7ca0285acfec090e21e701ab4c3cc2f2aeb3ff0711a033
b) What impact would the establishment of such a mechanism have on private sector investment and government programs to fund the provision of modern telecommunications services? Rogers submits that the establishment of such a mechanism could have a negative impact by interfering with pricing signals for private sector investment, and it leads to the uneconomic deployment of resources. Rogers submits that the basic service objective should be revised to include high-speed Internet connectivity at speeds of / Mbps, at a minimum. This level of service supports current basic applications and also could replace the current low-speed Internet service and encompass voice communications as a basic service objective. Rogers does not believe there should be an obligation to serve. Rogers submits that broadband Internet service should be defined as a basic telecommunications services and provided as part of the basic service objective at speeds of / Mbps, at a minimum. As explained above, Rogers submits that the voice services included in the current basic service objective can be provided to any customer where there is a / Mbps high-speed Internet connection. As explained above in response to question  c), Rogers submits that if the existing local service subsidy funds continue to be collected, the funds should be redirected to support broadband Internet service included in the basic service objective. The necessary cost information to address the quantum of any subsidy for the basic service objective, if required, should be assessed in a follow-up process based on key principles established as the result of this proceeding. Also as explained above, Rogers does not believe that an industry-funded subsidy program is either necessary or desirable. Information already provided to the Commission has identified access to backhaul transport facilities at reasonable cost as a key limiter in delivering affordable higher-speed Internet services.

Policy guides industry. It can be used to preserve legacy technologies that are still essential. It  can be used to foster investment and innovation that serve the evolving social and economic  needs of the nation. To this end, the outcome of this proceeding should be a policy that deters  continued investment in legacy broadband technology such as DSL and foster investment  in future proof technologies. Speed standard must be set to evolve to progressively  replace technologies that have no future. Basic Service  . There is agreement that the Internet is a Basic Service. However, the Commission must examine  the meaning of “Internet”. As a Telecommunications regulator, the Commission does not  regulate applications, does not decide that one application is essential while another one is  not. It regulates access to a network. As such Section  should push the Commission to focus  on adoption of future proof technology that foster growth in the digital economy instead of  choosing to protect incumbent’s legacy infrastructure. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER a4bf4d584b20029b02d6a63c1ec7ab749c20e24bbf1df8e99013b5127286e479
It means that  any customer should be able to get such speed should he/she want it. ISPs are free to offer  lower speeds. For instance a store selling tomatoes may only require kbs service for  its POS terminal while the store next door wants gbps service because they copy large  videos back and forth. During the hearing, Vaxination provided a table of suggested speed “steps” that provide  clear guidance on what technology has reached a dead end for each step (ADSL, ADSL,  VDSL, and need for cablecos to upgrade the mhz upload repeaters). These steps also  allow fixed wireless operators to discuss with Industry Canada how much spectrum is needed  to serve a community to meet those standards. Affordability  . There are  issues with regards to affordability:  (a) Deploying more cost effective systems  (b) providing financial help to consumers    More cost effective deployments  . Incumbents are addicted to the high profit margins and high ARPU of large cities. As a  result they are not interested in rural investments which have lower profit margins and ARPU  (although ARPU can be fixed by raising prices in rural areas which is what Bell Canada  has proposed). What an incumbent is considers a High Cost Service Area may be a low cost deployment  for a municipality with local staff, and efficient deployment and more importantly, no need  to match Rosedale profit margins. Fibre has long reach to serve everyone in a community. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER a4bf4d584b20029b02d6a63c1ec7ab749c20e24bbf1df8e99013b5127286e479
Those with expertise in the area of social assistance can provide vital input to finding solutions. iv) Rogers supports the Commission’s call for a National Broadband Strategy (NBS). The NBS offers the best opportunity to harness the resources of the Commission, in concert with all levels of government and the private sector, to address the gaps in availability of broadband Internet and barriers to its adoption. Rogers recommends an Advisory Council to provide leadership, coordination, and oversight of the NBS, as described in the Terms of Reference filed previously. Basic Broadband Internet  ES. The standard for basic broadband Internet service should be set at a minimum of  Mbps download and  Mbps upload. This service standard strikes a reasonable balance between the benefits of broadband connectivity and the costs of achieving this objective in the near-term. The estimates of costs to achieve a higher service standard would likely far outstrip available funding, while the substantial burden on taxpayers or consumers to provide sufficient funding would be unacceptably high. It is not evident that a higher speed standard is realistically achievable, or necessary to achieve the requirements for a basic service. Future targets should establish higher service speeds as the goal. Rogers recommends  Mbps download and  Mbps upload as a reasonable objective within five years. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 6d7e9726390e212096f56209470bc92f411b7fae3814ca2c9a918c124f106398
Consumers should have the right to choose how much data they require. The choice between different levels of data usage is conceptually similar to choices available under the current basic telecom service which ensures access to long distance calling and optional calling features for voice telephony but does not dictate their inclusion as part of a basic service package. An obligation to serve is not necessary where competitive market forces are sufficient to protect the interests of users, as is the case for broadband Internet service. In addition, the Commission does not have the jurisdiction to mandate the provision of broadband Internet service at minimum speeds in areas that are underserved or unserved. This position is shared among all the major carriers and supported by independent legal opinions. Availability of Basic Broadband Internet ES. Broadband Internet service is already widely available, and availability continues to expand through several private and public sector initiatives, including deployments that are expected to provide speeds greater than / Mbps. A new round of federal government funding could result in over $ billion in new public-private investment in broadband Internet facilities. This amount of funding would be enough to provide / Mbps service to households without / Mbps today. Solutions to any gaps in availability should reflect differences in the underlying reasons for the gaps. Near-urban pockets may be located near existing transport facilities that can be utilized by accessing existing rights of way and support structures, or partnering with those that have access to such facilities.

This follows the e-Community Strategy  articulated by the Assembly of First Nations and presented to the Commission in the  FMCC’s past interventions (e.g. interventions of FMCC and K'atl'odeeche First Nation in  TNC -). That said, in general the members of these communities require sufficient capacity,  speed, and low latency to provide a range of services including online banking, e-health,  telemedicine, e-commerce, distance education, and e-government services. This  ensures that community members will have the same access to the essential public and  commercial services available to urban Canadians. As we have pointed out, online  access to these services is perhaps more important to rural and remote community  members because they lack the availability and range of services (healthcare,  education, food, supplies, etc.) Certain basic telecommunications services are required for all Canadians. Therefore the  Commission must ensure that a minimum Basic Service is in place for all people living in  Canada, regardless of their physical location. We expand our definition of what this  'Basic Service' should include later in this intervention. In the  report Putting the  last-mile First: Re-framing broadband development in First Nation and Inuit communities,  we noted that communities require two distinct, but interrelated, components: Broadband  Infrastructure and Connectivity. At present, government agencies and funding programs  sometimes conflate these two components and functions into a single concept of  ‘broadband connectivity’. For example, the First Nations Infrastructure Fund  administered by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) incorporated ‘broadband  connectivity’ into its funding mandate.

Identify which segments of the  Canadian population are experiencing such barriers. Response to QC: Barriers to participation: availability, affordability, quality, digital  literacy  . Numerous barriers limit or prevent Canadians from meaningfully participating in the  digital economy. Here we focus on barriers facing members of rural, remote, and  Northern communities and their organizations. In our answer we consider issues of  availability (in terms of access and affordability), quality, and digital literacy. Availability  . Availability includes both the access gaps and the affordability gaps that exist across  Canada's regions and localities. The OECD has noted: “Broadband is viewed as an  enabler of productivity and economic growth, but its impact on economies will depend on  broadband being used by business and consumers, which requires access to broadband  at low prices and good quality”. The Commission has determined that clear access divides exist and persist between:   • communities in the north and communities in the south;     • communities within the North; and  • organizations and households within these communities. A clear and persistent access gap exists between northern and southern Canada. The  Commission’s recent Satellite Inquiry (TNC -) determined that roughly ,  households in the three territories and the northern regions of the provinces lack access  to broadband Internet service at the Commission's target speeds (cited in TNC  -, para ).

Within these communities, access divides exist among individual households,  businesses and organizations. This highlights a last-mile – or in our terminology, First  Mile – challenge.

Northern community members also face an affordability gap for telecommunications  services. Benefits from broadband require high levels of adoption - not just availability. Regarding effective use of broadband infrastructure and services, there is no guarantee  that 'if you build it, the users will come'. In contrast, affordability is recognized by  regulatory institutions around the world as a key barrier to adoption and utilization of  broadband. For example, in the U.S, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration have both noted  the importance of affordability in closing digital divides.

We applaud the Commission's recent work with the SamKnows Internet  performance monitoring equipment and processes across Canada. However, the  process by which participants were selected has not been transparent. The  CRTC  should clarify whether its current broadband measurement initiative accurately and  comprehensively represent service levels in all regions of the country, and if not, what  remedial steps it will take. We suggest that the Commission also consider complementary monitoring initiatives in  order to ensure that it is getting an accurate picture of the Canadian broadband  performance landscape. For example, researchers affiliated with the FMCC are currently  working with remote communities to develop a “First Mile Approach to Internet  Measurement” that will support community members to undertake their own  performance tests using an open source tool development by the Canadian Internet  Registration Authority (CIRA).   CRTC Q: Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic  telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully  participate in the digital economy? Response to Q: Which services should be considered basic telecommunications  services? In Telecom Decision - Telephone Service to High Cost Serving Areas (TD -)  the Commission established the basic service objective, which includes:   • individual line local touch-tone service;  • capability to connect to the Internet via low-speed data transmission at local rates;  • access to the long distance network, operator/directory assistance services,   enhanced calling features and privacy protection features, emergency services, as  well as voice message relay service; and   • a printed copy of the current local telephone directory upon request. All Canadians, including those living in remote and Northern regions, require universal  access to reliable and affordable telecommunications services. Today, basic  telecommunications services include broadband Internet access, and the CRTC's  policies and regulations must be updated to account for this fact. Other OECD countries  already recognize broadband as an essential telecommunications service. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3373f3fc176dc8bcbf75b70284d83ee1197d7523299bd507a9f7198c5610fff7
With regards to determining pricing, other jurisdictions  provide guidance for determining equitable pricing for Basic Services that include a  basket of services and estimates of per capita income. The International  Telecommunication Union (ITU), for example, has created an ICT Price Basket, which  measures the affordability of fixed and mobile telephony and fixed broadband Internet  services. The ITU has developed methodologies to estimate affordability by comparing  broadband prices in roughly  economies relative to incomes as a way to measure  affordability. It also notes that expenditure (budget) surveys designed to measure  household expenditure are also used by a number of countries to identify household  access to ICT equipment and services.

Subsequently, in Telecom  Regulatory Policy CRTC - Northwestel Inc. — Regulatory Framework,  Modernization Plan, and related matters (TRP CRTC -) the Commission  determined that Northwestel possesses significant and persistent market power and  therefore re-introduced the regulation of terrestrial Internet services in the region. As  recently as this year, the Commission has acted to ensure that Northwestel’s tariffed  services remain affordable for Northern Residents (TD CRTC -, Northwestel Inc.  — Tariffs for terrestrial retail Internet services). The CRTC’s inquiry concerning fixed satellite services is also an example of its role in  examining barriers to providing basic services that include broadband and are affordable  for northern residents (TNC -). On the one hand, the Commission must act to constrain the existing market power of  dominant firms such as Northwestel and Telesat, as it has in the examples given above. On the other, it must act to foster progressive policy solutions designed to promote an  efficient, innovative telecommunications environment that serves the needs of all   Page ! of !     Canadians. The community intermediaries who are providing and who will provide  service in rural, remote, isolated, and northern communities form an integral part of this  goal, and the Commission should take steps to ensure that they are able to meet the  needs of the communities they serve. CRTC Q: In Telecom Regulatory Policy -, the Commission stated that it would  closely monitor developments in the industry regarding the achievement of its  broadband Internet target speeds to determine whether regulatory intervention may be  needed. Response to Q: Target speed monitoring  . We applaud the Commission's recent actions to implement a permanent monitoring  mechanism (SamKnows) to measure whether service providers are fulfilling Basic  Service obligations. This is a key initiative for community members in northern and  remote regions, who have faced access and affordability gaps for too long already.

We also note that the “Basic Service” obligation and the obligation to serve should  contemplate the needs of communities as well as those of individual community  members. Communities as well as individuals are consumers, citizens, and creators,  and utilize telecommunications infrastructures and services in those ways. This  recognition involves providing transport to the intermediary organizations set up by - and  accountable to - these communities. It also recognizes that Basic Services encompass a  community focus as well as a home (household focus) in terms of developing and  managing telecommunications infrastructure. While access to Basic Services is typically  defined in terms of households, we emphasize the need to also provide those services  to community organizations: health, education, and social service agencies such as  clinics, schools, libraries, and businesses. of !     CRTC Q: Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications  service? Response to Q: Broadband is a basic service  . The Commission's definition of “Basic Service” must include broadband. When the  Commission first engaged with the issue in  (Telecom Decision CRTC -  Telephone service to high-cost serving areas (TD -) broadband was an emerging  technology; today it is a fundamental element of the telecommunications system. As the  Commission has noted, access to broadband is necessary for Canadians to participate  in the digital economy. We note that IP technology is increasingly used to deliver voice  as well as data and video services. Chairman Blais has publicly endorsed IP technology  as the best means to address future needs. We provided evidence above in response to Question  above that access to broadband  is critical for social and economic development of northern and Indigenous populations. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3373f3fc176dc8bcbf75b70284d83ee1197d7523299bd507a9f7198c5610fff7
We also addressed the need for a revised definition of Basic Services in Question   above. Along with broadband, the definition of ‘Basic Service’ should include the following  components:   • Voice telephony (both local and long distance) on individual lines or circuits  • Additional services, including access to emergency services, Voice Message Relay   Service, and privacy protection features (as specified in TD -);   • A directory with contact information for fixed and mobile telephone listings that is   available in Indigenous languages and alphabets in regions with significant  Indigenous populations. Hard copy directories should be updated and delivered  annually to communities. Directory information should also be provided online with  annual updates. Hard copies of directories are necessary because not all community  members will be able to access online directories, and some may prefer hard copies. Affordability should also be included as a component of basic service. The Commission  implicitly recognized the importance of affordability in  when it included in basic  service “the capability to connect to the Internet via low-speed data transmission at local  rates” at a time when rural residents typically had to pay long distance rates to reach an  ISP. This component should take into account the limits that are often placed on Internet  services (data caps), which in effect amount to rates that limit the utility of Internet  services, particularly for low-income users. of !     CRTC Q: What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service subsidy  regime? What resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory  frameworks (e.g. Response to Q: Expand eligibility beyond ILECS, to include community intermediaries  .

According to TNC -, retail Internet revenues are not currently eligible in these  contributions ‑ – despite the fact that they account for growing annual revenues for  telecommunications companies — although it is unclear whether this item would include  such services as mobile broadband. In this consultation, the Commission is effectively asking whether the level of these  contributions should be changed. We believe that the Commission should expand the  eligible contributions because under the expanded definition of Basic Services we  propose above, which includes broadband delivered over fixed or mobile facilities,  additional funding will be required, and  retail Internet services - and associated  revenues - are now a fundamental and growing element of telecommunications services. In TNC -, the Commission notes that: “In , revenues for the retail  telecommunications service industry were approximately $ billion, and these revenues  continue to grow annually, primarily due to the increasing use of wireless and Internet   ! TNC CRTC -, paragraph .   See Decision CRTC - Changes to the contribution regime, beginning at paragraph . of !     services”. In the  Telecommunications Monitoring Report, the Commission notes  that: “the total annual revenues from the provision of telecommunications services in  Canada is $. billion.”  In fact, in  retail wireline Internet revenues grew to equal  local wireline voice revenues for the first time, and previous growth trends strongly  suggest that Internet revenue has likely surpassed local voice since then. We endorse the position of the Eeyou Communication Network (ECN)  in their  submission to this proceeding, which argues that all revenues of all telecommunications  services should be subject to the telecommunications revenue-eligible fee for the  subsidy regime  - with a key exception. The Commission should maintain the exemption  for telecommunications providers with revenues under $ million. This exemption is  designed to encourage competition, particularly among smaller organizations and  community intermediary organizations. The Commission should allocate these new funds to an independently-managed non- profit national fund, publicly licensed by the CRTC, which we describe in response to  Question  below.

As of this date, Xplornet has not responded to our request. We again assert that it is in the public interest for Canadians to know how their tax   dollars have been spent. Further, during the hearing, the Commissioners specifically  requested information that would help them understand how much funding would be  required to extend service to unserved and underserved communities and residents,  including estimates based on data from previous projects. FMCC and several other  intervenors have submitted funding information on the public record. We believe that  all intervenors should do so. Required Parameters for Basic Broadband:    . Speed: Xplornet “believes email, electronic banking, software updates, being able to   search for educational or health information, and the ability to access government  services, form the basis of what defines basic service.” Xplornet and several  intervenors conclude that  mbps down/ mbps up is a sufficient requirement for  basic service. We believe that higher speeds should be required because of the  trend for more content and software to be located in “the cloud,” requiring uploads  and downloads of large files, and the increasing use of video for educational  applications (rather than solely for entertainment) and interactive videoconferencing  for a variety of applications including meetings, interviews, and webinars. Bell states: “For those activities that do require increased bandwidth, cloud based  services are available to meet their needs” (Bell Canada Final Submission). But Bell  ignores the need for increased bandwidth to be able to access these cloud-based  services. FMCC member organizations have stressed that local communities and their   regional intermediary organizations require sufficient bandwidth to deliver  telemedicine applications, two-way symmetrical videoconferencing, e-learning     	  applications, justice applications, home-care applications and a host of online  applications that local individuals, families, households, organizations and  businesses require.

Other parties provided fulsome responses   to this question. See for example, Rogers(CNOC)Aug- and Cogeco(CNOC)Aug-. For additional clarification, “wholesale regulation for subsidized services” refers to   mandated wholesale access to any subsidized facilities used to provide broadband Internet   services. The meaning of “affordability” is self-evident. The term “adequate quality” refers to   traditional quality of service characteristics. Finally, “subsidized retail services” refers to any retail   services that will be provisioned using subsidized facilities, including any facilities that may be   subsidized as a result of this proceeding (e.g. broadband Internet services).

I had to go this  route because my other ISP could not provide the speed I needed for my computer          business. I also stayed with  ISP's because my Satellite ISP could not provide enough  download usage per month(GB). I am currently looking to change ISP's again because  the Fixed Wireless is not working and the ISP is unresponsive to fixing it.” (OFA Survey  Results, Response , pg. )    “Our current ISP (Rogers) will not expand service to the nd house on this farm. We  have to get creative to solve the problem (wireless routers etc.) There are no other  service providers. There are no extra phone lines to even get dial-up & satellite is too  slow to be useful.” (OFA Survey Results, Response , pg. )   The need for a secondary connection in many cases relates to the fact that nearly % of those surveyed  identifying their internet service/connection as unreliable. Specifically, the comments provided  throughout the survey noted a number of challenges related to unreliable download/upload speeds  during periods of peak traffic and/or poor weather conditions (particularly for those relying on fixed  wireless and satellite connections). Drawing upon comments received through the OFA survey results, a number of examples of specific  reliability issues were identified:   “Bell discontinued the service type that we had and we were forced to sign up for their  "Hub" service which is more expensive and supposed to be faster. It is very slow and  unreliable. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER eb9291e34fe8ab06479db5c478e5a8f1a04a7152ea8aa043c08ad1f823ab4d0b

Regardless of whether a  government mechanism to subsidize telecommunications in some areas exists , the private sector  w ill only make an investment in infrastructure if it makes business sense. If a subsidization  mechanism is used as a last resort rather than entering the market a competitive service provider,  it should not distort the market or negatively impact existing government programs to incentivize  private sector investment in rural and isolated areas.

However, the basic service objective should be updated to include high-speed  broadband internet access. ~at  other services, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory frameworl<? AAMDC response: Broadband internet should be defined as a basic telecommunications service. ~at  resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory frameworl<s (e.g. price  cap regimes)? AAMDC response: The spirit of the local service subsidy regime is effective in ensuring rural  residents receive telecommunications services.

It is important that expanding the regime be accompanied by  an expansion of price cap regulations to apply to broadband service in areas where the local  service subsidy regime is applied. Your  response should address, with supporting rationale, which TSPs should be required to  contribute to the NCF, which revenues should be contribution-eligible and which revenues, if  any, should be excluded from the calculation of contribution-eligible revenues. AAMDC response: The AAMDC lacks the technical knowledge to respond to this question. Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications services be  subsidized? Explain, with supporting details, what services should be subsidized and under  what circumstances? AAMDC response: As mentioned in previous questions, basic services should be subsidized in  situations where geography prevents the private sector from developing the necessary  infrastructure. The local service subsidy regime provides an example of how subsidization can be  targeted to a specific geographic region without corrupting the market basis for  telecommunications development in the majority of the country. If there is a need to establish a new funding mechanism to support the provision of modem  telecommunications services, describe how this mechanism would operate. Your response  should address the mechanism described in Telecom Regulatory Policy - for  transport services and/or any other mechanism necessary to support modem  telecommunications services across Canada.

The purpose of Review of basic telecommunications services, Telecom Notice of Consultation - (as amended)—initiated more than one year ago—is worth recalling:  The Commission hereby initiates a proceeding to conduct a comprehensive review of its policies regarding basic telecommunications services in Canada and of the telecommunications services that Canadians require to participate meaningfully in the digital economy. In this regard, the Commission will examine how these telecommunications services are used by Canadians, and what prices Canadians should be expected to pay for these services. The Commission will also examine the availability of telecommunications services to determine which areas in Canada are underserved or unserved. The Commission will consider what its role should be in ensuring the availability of basic telecommunications services, particularly in rural and remote regions of Canada. [footnoteRef:] [:  	TNC - at paras. This proceeding is fundamentally about ensuring Canadians have access to “basic telecommunications services”. The proceeding is not about ensuring all Canadians can access high-end telecommunications services, or “wants”, but about facilitating “the orderly development throughout Canada of a telecommunications system that serves to safeguard, enrich and strengthen the social and economic fabric of Canada and its regions”; rendering “reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada”; and responding to the “economic and social requirements of users of telecommunications services”. [footnoteRef:]  [:  	Telecommunications Act, ss. (a), (b) and (h).] While there are many complex issues to be resolved, basically the parties and interveners can be divided into two groups when it comes to perspectives about the Commission’s role in respect of Canadians’ access to basic telecommunications services: 	  () The “do nothing” grouping: Parties/interveners who generally believe everything is fine as is, and that no Commission intervention is necessary. These are generally large telecommunications service providers (“TSPs”),[footnoteRef:] which consistently earn handsome returns by offering faster and faster speeds to their urban customers, often marketed using the language of needs, while generally ignoring less densely populated areas and the needs of low-income Canadians. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3ee59ce2b59a1a390cb0780a6648ded460d33aaeacfb3c0fce895073b5780002
The AAC detailed what it believes the Commission must do to improve access to basic telecommunications services by supporting deployment via the Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism (“BDFM”) and supporting access by low-income households with the Affordability Funding Mechanism (“AFM"). This was detailed at length in the AAC’s initial intervention, further intervention, interrogatory responses, and in the “Action Plan” synopsis in the AAC’s final submission. The AAC believes that the most obvious immediate action the Commission should initiate, based on the record, is to declare broadband of at least  Mbps download and  Mbps upload ("/"), if not /, to be a basic telecommunications service, and to implement an affordability subsidy. Doing nothing cannot be an option, and it would be a mistake to say that the targets from - remain appropriate. [bookmark: _Toc]Point #. Broadband is “basic”, and “basic” broadband is at least / Mbps  . The AAC believes the Commission will recognize broadband is a basic telecommunications service. [footnoteRef:] As to what speed is “basic”, the AAC presented and detailed its “- rule”[footnoteRef:], and also presented a detailed user needs analysis. [:  	TNC - Transcript, Vol. [:  	To reiterate, the - rule, developed by the European Commission, considers a telecommunications service as “basic” for the purposes of determining required universal service if % of the population subscribes to a service, and % of those subscribers do so at given speed or other relevant measurable quality. See AAC First Intervention ( July ), at para. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3ee59ce2b59a1a390cb0780a6648ded460d33aaeacfb3c0fce895073b5780002
The  data suggested that the primary reason that Canadians were not using the internet was that they were not interested in it. At that time, % of non-users indicated this was their main reason for not using the internet, compared to just % who explicitly identified the cost of service or equipment as the primary reason for non-use. While recent research from Ipsos Public Affairs  supports this finding, there is evidence from the US  that affordability is an important barrier to access, as individuals increasingly recognize that the internet is becoming essential to everyday life. In developing policies to ensure universal access to telecommunications services, a focus on affordability must be a central component. ***End of document*** � Middleton, C. ().

Specific measures noted above have been developed by MAC/Access  based on the set of   questions outlined in the TNC CRTC - Notice of Consultation. Implementing them is   therefore within the scope of this proceeding and the authority the Parliament has assigned to the   Commission. We support the calls by the Commission for future consultations on a broader   national strategy and respectfully request that interests of Canadians with disabilities are   included in any future discussion. However, prospects of future consultations to develop a   national strategy do not represent a viable substitute for actions that are within the scope of this   proceeding or responsibilities the Parliament has specifically assigned to the CRTC as an   independent sector specific regulator with respect to scope, service standards, and   implementation of basic service obligations. MAC/Access  submit that time for action is   today as the costs of waiting for some “advisory council” to come up with a national strategy or   another CRTC review of basic services five years from now would be too high for Canadians   with disabilities that require accessible, reliable, and affordable basic fixed and mobile   broadband services they require for deploying Internet applications and services they need to   participate in social and economic activities. Comments      . Media Access Canada/Access  Coalition of disabilities stakeholders act as the united voice   for a wide range of national organizations representing Canadians with disabilities, including   those who are blind, have low vision, are deaf, hard of hearing, or have cognitive or mobility   disabilities. MAC/Access ’s objective is to achieve full accessibility of broadcasting and   communications services by  for all Canadians with disabilities. Questions regarding the design of Canada’ basic service policy framework outlined in TNC   CRTC - before the Commission are of critical importance to the ability of Canadians   with disabilities to access and use fixed and mobile broadband Internet access services. We   therefore thank the Commission for the opportunity to participate in this proceeding and   considering strategies that we have detailed for addressing gaps in accessibility, quality, and   affordability of access to broadband Internet connectivity facing Canadians with disabilities. To ensure that all Canadians, including those with disabilities, low incomes, or living in high   cost rural areas, we submit that redefining “high-speed”/broadband Internet access represents a   necessary first step in updating Canada’s basic service framework. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER e854ccfbd7ad9eb7b2cd61b4b53d72f6a83cc947102eb0008553da39053da25b
Alternatively, if the Commission chooses to implement the National   Disabilities Subsidy Fund (NDSF) MAC/Access  have proposed to support access to fixed   and mobile connectivity for Canadians with severe or very severe disabilities, then part of the   operational expenditures from the DRO could be allocated from the NDSF. We find direct   industry funding for a DRO, as is the case for the CCTS, problematic as it will inevitably come   at a cost in terms of governance and effectiveness of the DRO in advocating for Canadians with   disabilities. We strongly urge the CRTC to prioritize developing a DRO in order to demonstrate its   commitment to efficient public regulations that support private sector incentives to deliver basic   communications services Canadians with disabilities demand. We submit that CRTC leadership   is required in this matter as establishing a DRO at other federal agencies or a decentralized   approach that makes provinces and lower levels of the government, nor no-for-profit   organizations such as MAC, responsible for the problem is not likely to be an effective strategy   to counteracting persistent and evident market failures in serving the basic communications   needs of Canadians with disabilities. A DRO along the lines MAC/Access  have recommended represents a low cost and high   return option for addressing some of the gaps our stakeholders and various other representatives   of the disabilities community have detailed before the Commission in this matter. Quality of Service: Basic Service Package with Minimum Service Quality Guarantees      . Even if the Commission established an effective DRO that helps increase awareness and   capacity of service providers in serving the disabilities community, it will not address pernicious   service quality and affordability gaps that are of significant concern for the MAC/Access    Coalition stakeholders. For Canadians with disabilities, gaps in terms of quality of services (actual performance versus   advertised “best effort”/“up to xMbps” rates) that exist in both urban and rural parts of the   country represent a particular concern. This is because for our stakeholders, particularly those   with severe and very severe disabilities, information technologies that reliable fixed and mobile   broadband enable are not just an augmentation of communications, but represent essential tools   for engaging in communications and socioeconomic interactions with others. Reliability and   safety of use of various assistive, monitoring, and otherwise enabling applications also require   some level of minimum service level standards. This is why MAC/Access  have   recommended the Commission adopts a basic service package that includes minimum service   quality guarantees of reliability.

Sample of Internet Test Site provided by CIRA            . We have appended to this document a speed-test survey conducted in the Eeyou   Istchee communities in early  (Appendix ). The statistical analysis was performed   on the Bell (Aliant) DSL delivery system in (Eeyou Istchee) Mistissini, Waskaganish and   Eastmain and in the James Bay community of Radisson. Despite the shortcomings cited   above concerning Ookla, the test was conducted using that platform. Cree Nation Government    Eeyou Communications Network                                                                  TNC -   December             Page  of   ________________________________________________________________________      What Internet Tests should measure? The Internet Experience      . Internet service test characteristics need to go beyond standard tests such as speed,   latency and ping. Tests also need to evaluate the Internet experience, where the user is   not frustrated by an inability to be heard, to be seen or to participate. The Internet   measurement community defines Quality of Internet Experience as user reaction to   Internet performance: Chetty (full reference in paragraph ), for example, cites data caps   as a limiting cause as it creates a sense of anxiety. Telcos and DSL providers dismiss the   need for greater bandwidth and speed by saying they should not be obliged to provide   video capacity; but the bandwidth capability is required to go beyond simple You-Tube   watching. Imagine a student who takes a course in distance education that wants to ask a   real-time question with a visual example, or a person who wants to make an urgent   appointment based on time-sensitive availability, or even a commercial transaction where   a bid can be rejected because it is a few moments late.

We are located in a  lot subdivision,  km south of Christina Lake and just  km North of the Canada- USA border crossing on Highway . We are obviously not stuck in the middle of nowhere. Internet service provider options remain only Telus dialup or Telus "stick". Xplornet does not provide a signal to this area, which remains a mystery to us all. We subscribe to the Telus stick for $ per month to a limit of  mb per month. that is not a typo! My wife has a home based business which requires extensive Internet use for research etc. On average we spend $ per month to Telus AND, since she requires a few more mb's than  per month, she rents an office in the town AND pays for a ShawCable high speed connection there. It is inefficient and expensive. What costs $ per month  km away in Christina Lake, we pay over $, including this needless office space. Any help or consideration you could provide would be very sincerely appreciated. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER f80dadf76fed4ec16c2af353f89d1edd548636b12d3075d1e48c14782fd3761c
We received incredible input through these sessions and it has helped us to   focus on addressing the needs of this customer base. We believe the discussions have     Shaw Communications Inc.  Report on Accessibility  TRP CRTC -         ## Denotes information filed in confidence with the Commission       Appendix A.  Page |       helped to break down any perceived barriers and created a basis for ongoing   collaboration and feedback. We found that three themes continued to surface during our discussions with customers   about accessibility features and services. The themes are      Awareness. Not only customer awareness of accessibility features, products or   services Shaw and Freedom offer but also awareness for employees on how to   respond to persons with accessibility needs, how to use or troubleshoot accessibility   services and how to match the right product to the customer.  Communication. Information must be accessible for all persons whether their   preferred method is through a website, chat, phone, e-mail, in-home, in person or on-  line self support videos. Making sure that accessibility services or features do not remain static. Technology is changing rapidly and accessibility services must evolve with those   changes rather than being left behind or forgotten. We have structured our report around these themes to help identify our vision for   addressing each of these specific areas of concern. In the following sections we provide   a description of Shaw’s ongoing and future accessibility initiatives. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 3e94bd0e9ac30af1ad0ca0864f061fc720eb2efa264f00c3c717569ff3785529
Our site developers and testers   are required to undertake testing of new or revised pages and verify WC compliance   prior to the launch of any new page. This dual-phase approach will provide certainty   that our webpages will continue to be as accessible as possible now and in the future. To help our internal teams better understand the challenges faced by the Blind   community when it comes to websites and to assist in designing more accessible   pages, Shaw will be purchasing licenses for the JAWS screen reader software. Teams   responsible for development of Shaw webpages and other customer materials will use   this software when assessing the accessibility of digital communications to our   customers. Details on Shaw’s and Freedom’s website WC compliance project and progress can   be viewed in Appendix A.. COMMUNICATION   A. Accessibility Feedback   . Our focus group discussions revealed that often simple things can make an   extraordinary difference to a person facing accessibility barriers. During our   discussions we became aware of many of these “little” items that could have been   rectified earlier if we had only known that it was creating challenges for a segment of   our customers. Shaw recognizes that the best way to know of these challenges is to simply ask. Therefore, we are committed to creating avenues to better gather feedback from our   customers who face accessibility barriers.

In TRP - the Commission directed Bell Canada, Bell Mobility Inc., Cogeco, Eastlink, MTS, RCCI, SaskTel, Shaw, TCC, and Videotron to each submit, no later than six months from the date of issuance of TRP -, a detailed report concerning their respective plans to invest in the ongoing accessibility of their telecommunications services. Cogeco currently complies with several regulatory obligations that have been determined by the Commission over the years which focus on making telecommunications and broadcasting services more accessible to persons with special needs or disabilities. A number of products and services are currently provided by Cogeco in order to enhance the accessibility of our services. The following briefly describes services and products currently offered to Cogeco customers with accessibility challenges, as well as certain features that are being investigated or are already on the roadmap for implementation. TELECOMMUNICATIONS . With respect to telecommunications services Cogeco implemented Message Relay Services, including TTY and IP Relay, and most recently Video Relay Service (VRS). In fact, when VRS was launched, our customer care centre reached out to registered Cogeco IP Relay users to notify them of the good news. Cogeco also offers free  service to customers who identify as being blind or visually impaired. Cogeco will support these services on an on-going basis. In addition, we are evaluating the technical and commercial feasibility of disassociating the IP Relay service from voice services.

Unifor members – as workers whose livelihoods are tied to this vital industry – are deeply connected to the services they provide and look forward to seeing positive progress as a result of the Commission’s review. Canadians rely heavily on telecommunications services for a variety of needs. While Canadians do still use telephone (wireline or wireless) to meet some of these needs, more services are now being provided and accessed online. Companies, government  agencies and educational institutions have looked to better serve Canadians by improving their online platforms and connecting to people digitally. This raises the need to ensure that Canadians not only have access to basic internet service, but access to reliable, fast and affordable internet service. How telecommunications services are used by Canadians  . Canadians now rely heavily on the internet for accessing a myriad of government services. Government websites at all levels provide essential information for individuals who are trying to navigate the various services and programs available. Millions of Canadians directly access government services online – such as applying for Employment Insurance, applying for a passport, applying for the Canada Pension Plan, obtaining student loan relief and renewing a license plate sticker, among others. According to the Canada Revenue Agency, % of tax returns are now filed electronically. It is without surprise that Canadians have shifted online when government services are made available in that platform.

Participating meaningfully in the digital economy in the years to come  . As Canada’s digital economy continues to grow and evolve over the next decade, it is evident that Canadians will be increasingly relying on internet services and connected devices. Internet access enables Canadians to better access government services, pursue    Page  of   educational opportunities, meet commercial and consumer needs, access entertainment and news, and expand their social and professional lives. There will continue to be an increased demand and need for home internet service, along with wireless and data services that support the use of smart mobile devices. The CRTC plays a central role in ensuring that Canadians have greater access to these services in the years to come. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services  . The Commission plays an important role in establishing regulatory measures to ensure that Canadians have proper access to basic telecommunications services. The basic service objective, in particular, provides the framework of services that incumbent local exchange carriers are obliged to provide to meet the basic needs of Canadians. Services that should be considered as basic communications services  . The basic service objective outlines a suite of services that include basic local telephone, long distance, operator/directory assistance, emergency services, voice message relay, privacy protection and local telephone directory. In its  consultation (CRTC - ), the Commission concluded that broadband internet access services should not be included in the objective and that the deployment of these services should continue to rely on market forces and targeted government funding. As technology and the economy continue to evolve, so too do the telecommunications needs of Canadians. The fast changing landscape gives reason for regular review of regulatory measures like the basic service objective, especially if market forces aren’t filling the service gaps. The Commission should closely examine measures to increase access of broadband internet services, especially as Canadians continue to – and are required to – engage in the digital economy, and as the gaps between different groups of Canadians (e.g. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER a88d8116510ea2bda8c38be0168a1735771e0854c16d8bb273e32ab1bf4783e4

While most of the parties appear to agree on this point, there are some differences in the manner in which regulated entities and the other parties characterize the magnitude of existing gaps or the standards of service the Commission should adopt pursuant to this proceeding. EOWC/EORN are particularly pleased to see that our recommendations are consistent with those made by rural communities and consumer groups from across the country such as the First Mile Connectivity Consortium (FMCC) and OpenMedia. In this submission, we build on the experience in Eastern Ontario to answer three specific questions raised by the Commission regarding gap identification, best practices, and the role of different levels of government in achieving basic service objectives of the Telecommunications Act. [footnoteRef:]  [:  Paragraphs -, CRTC - hearing transcript. On behalf of the residents, businesses, municipal governments, and other Eastern Ontario stakeholders concerned about quality and affordability of access to basic communications services, we urge the Commission to:  . Define high-speed/broadband Internet access as a basic service under the Telecommunications Act. High-speed broadband internet is already essential for most Canadians to participate in the economic and social discourse of our country. Recognizing this technological and economic reality in the federal regulatory framework represents an important first step toward addressing gaps identified on the record of this proceeding about coverage, service quality, and affordability of access to broadband Internet connectivity. For rural communities, mobile network coverage and the availability of high-speed mobile data services with minimum service quality guarantees are critical for communication between our residents, visitors, and emergency service workers. We recommend including both fixed and mobile broadband in the basic service framework   . Mandate concrete minimum standards of basic service.

All of the large telecom providers have been built on the backs of massive government subsidies, grants and funding. I applaud their efforts to push for greater services to Canadians, but it's dangerous to allow them to continue to charge a premium for providing the services paid for by our own tax dollars. Looking at the profit margins of these providers and the pricing on their websites it is obvious that some level of collusion exists.

Internet should be considered an essential right of all Canadians. It underpins every aspect of a geographically diverse and expansive land. It facilitates easy communication, expressive cultural exchange, access to necessary financial institutions and allows for ongoing political discourse. These are only the most obvious NECESSARY aspects of the internet. Our current internet is overpriced and it's providers offer NO realistic differentiation in service. It is not universal. Our major providers have done little to nothing to promote/create internet access in those areas that most need it. Big Telco does not NEED or DESERVE any form of subsidization. The CRTC needs to ensure the following basic governing rules: ) Basic bandwidth levels need to be established. ) Universal access is necessary.

When a populace has over % of it's income sent to the Federal government in the form of taxes, levies or other fees, there is an expectation that the needs of the individual should take precedent over the wants of the corporation. There is essentially no cost associated with bandwidth. The average consumer that subscribes to cable TV uses over  terabytes of bandwidth in a year, bandwidth that is INCLUDED with a cable subscription.

It does not seem to matter how many different companies I try, either cable or DSL, the story is the same. Aside from complaining about the slow speed, or cancelling this service and trying another, I have no recourse. Frankly, the prospect of finding an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that actually delivers the advertised speed is pretty bleak. Large companies are just as bad, except much more expensive. I propose a couple of solutions:  . Nationalize internet service. The internet infrastructure is too important to leave in private (profit seeking corporate) hands. Private companies have utterly failed to provide reliable, fairly priced, service in this country. There is no reason to believe this will change. Require fair advertising, and minimum standards. Instead of "up to" bandwidth, the emphasis should be on "minimum" bandwidth under which the cost should be either pro-rated or given free.

We NEED to match the US's recently changed broadband speed definition and even surpass it. Big telecom already makes billions, they don't need subsidies from us. they can fend for themselves. Help the smaller ISPs grow and create an actual competition in order for Big Telecom to feel the need to evolve and listen to the customer instead of simply hiking prices in unison to ensure larger profit margins without risking losing any customers.

Unless regulations are in place to keep costs lower and speed higher more and more of us will be priced out of having Internet access, and television access at all. It is a travesty that every Canadian cannot afford Internet, and even more of one that some, who are able to pay, do not have access to high speed internet services. There is so little competition in Canada and especially Vancouver for Internet, basically Shaw or Telus, and this keeps our prices for these services artificially high.

Considering its technical prowess,Canada has no excuse whatsoever to be providing its citizens with data access speeds and capabilities that, according to numerous, independent watchdog groups like OpenMedia and others, fall BELOW the top  countries in the world. This is inexcusable. The changes being recommended by these and other groups must, in concert with other legitimate government and corporate concerns, be taken into consideration.

Olivier Charron Laval HTZ Capitalism is fine when it brings companies to compete with each other to provide better services and products to the customer. However, when companies get together to offer similar services and products and in fact stop competing for the customer base, we end up with our current situation: companies conniving together to take money from the customer while no longer striving to improve the services and products provided. A company needs to exist to fulfill a customer's needs, if it doesn't, market rules dictate that it should disappear and be replaced by companies that want to meet the customer's needs. In proper capitalism, the customer benefits and that's where government entities come in to regulate and make sure that the type of capitalism applied is best for the customer.

Access must be affordable at world class broadband for % of the population. If we have third world internet speeds shouldn't we be paying third world countries prices? Canada's big content-owning networks, which are also Canada's major ISPs, seem to be all too ready to protect their legacy interests by charging more for internet traffic that threatens their lucrative broadcasting business.

Aside from   culture and art, the Internet also gives access to multiple video services such as Youtube, for   example, which have become a real treasure trove of “how-to” information for rural residents; if   you want to know how to knit a sweater or repair your tractor, Youtube has a wealth of   information. Rural residents must often be self-reliant, and this kind of video service has proven   to be very important. To truly get rural communities participating in society at the same level as the urban population,   Internet should be available at speeds supporting at least  TV sets in the home watching videos. Therefore CanWISP suggests that Mbps should be targeted in the  to  year timeframe. Page |    The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services   . Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic telecommunications  services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital   economy? CanWISP : CanWISP members are of the opinion that:   - Voice service is still essential for meaningful participation in the society. Voice is a simple means of transmitting information rapidly and carries   more information than just typed words. It is important to keep this asset. Our members’ networks can carry Voice over IP services and most of our   members offer this service. However, CanWISP members are hesitant to   call voice a basic service since this definition carries specific meaning in   terms of service obligations and subsidy allocations.

CanWISP: Under the current regime, ILECs have the obligation to offer voice services in HCSA,   and benefit from subsidies to do so. In addition, CanWISP members, as well as other ISPs, also   provide voice service in many HCSA. In areas where multiple service providers can offer voice   services, CanWISP believes that no service obligation should be enforced. As for broadband   services, competition is already present in most of Canada, since most of the territory that our   members cover is already serviced by satellite, which offers a minimum service, while CanWISP   members offer a higher class, more cost-effective service. CanWISP’s position is that there should   not be any obligations put on broadband service providers, since competition between satellite   services and WISPs is already adequate to ensure a high quality of service. c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should  these prices be determined? CanWISP: In most rural areas served by CanWISP members, the price for basic   telecommunications should be left to the market to decide. The ceiling price for an Internet   connection is set by the price of satellite service. This service is an effective cap on prices, since   in most areas, residents can choose a better internet service at a lesser cost with one of CanWISP’s   members. The price of a basic voice service from a practical perspective, is set by mobile access,   which, according to the latest CRTC report is available to % of the households. Residents can   also elect to have a home phone with less expensive voices services from CanWISP members, if   available.

Therefore,   we believe that the obligation to serve is necessary only locations where a single service   provider, or no service provider, exists.  In the case of broadband services in areas where wireless ISPs are active, coverage of  almost all subscribers is possible via the wireless network. In some cases where coverage   is difficult, the customer has the choice to pay for better receiving facilities (for example,   a tower for the receiving antenna); or to pay monthly fees for satellite service. In both   cases, we believe that no obligation to serve is necessary. What is required to ensure that   the customer has the best available Internet service, at the lowest monthly cost, are direct   subsidies for the construction of the wireless network and access to optimum spectrum for   the WISP; and subsidies to the customer for construction of improved receiving facilities   in cases where they are necessary. What  other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services? CanWISP: Our members are of the opinion that broadband Internet service should not be defined   as a basic telecommunications service. Although we do believe that Internet service is essential   for participation in modern-day economic and cultural life, our experience demonstrates that the   private sector is motivated to supply service, and is able to supply service in virtually all instances,   and it is not necessary for the CRTC to define it as a basic service and subsidize its operations. What  resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory frameworks (e.g. CanWISP: The existing subsidy regime is founded on two principles:   i. subsidized) consist only of voice services  ii.

View comments 	                                     Cathy Edwards - Tuesday, April ,  - :                       The message of the Canadian Association of Community Television Users and Stations (CACTUS) in this proceeding is that while it is crucial that all Canadians have broadband access, access to 'the pipes' is only half the opportunity and challenge. The other half is to ensure that all Canadians have access to digital skills training to leverage those pipes. It's a bit like the push in the s to ensure that all Canadians were linked via CBC broadcasting. More than  towers were built across the country. Had those towers not had transmitters and content radiating from them, the towers themselves would have been pointless. It's the same with broadband. Simultaneous to initiatives to extend broadband coverage, we must:  - ensure the availability of local and Canadian content and its 'discoverability' on the Internet  - ensure that Canadians and individuals, citizens, operators of small businesses and not-for-profits have the skills to leverage the Internet to serve them. CACTUS has been underlining the need since  of community-access media centres within reach of all Canadians where we can go to learn web design, how to access information, and how to create audio, video and gaming content. Public libraries have taken initial steps in this direction (by offering 'maker spaces' and 'hacklabs') but much more needs to be done. Community media practitioners with specific audio-visual and design skillsets are needed to bring the full potential of the web to Canadians for their own self-expression and to fully leverage the economic and communicative potential of the Internet. To this end, there needs to be co-ordination among Canadian Heritage, the new Ministry of Infrastructure and Communities; Science Innovation and Economic Development; and Employment, Workforce Development and Labour.

Or there is talk of having a new tax on out telecom bill to support the above. Why is it that I don't hear anyting about the private sector paying a tax? If we listen to the peoples in the remote area's, which are on file with the CRTC, such as people from Nunavut, they are really complaining about high bills and lousey ad's eating up their usage (Keep in mind they pay -$ month for low usage intermittent internet). Why not have a -%% tax on the ad and/or marketing industry in Canada which use the internet to get to people and bombard them with usage eating ads? Has anyone thought of that? If not, why not? Do you think people want those ads eating up their usage? So I ask the CRTC to consider a tax not just on the people, but on other industries such as the ad/marketing industry. Tax the The Canadian Marketing Association, google, yahoo etc. After all, they contribute to people usage, of which no one really wants.

Unfortunately this accessible project wound down in . CUPW does not have a specific submission at this time but we have commissioned research into the viability of using this treasured public asset as a delivery mechanism for broadband, cell phone and other digital services. While our research is ongoing, we feel that Canadians, and particularly rural Canadians, are underserved, and that the CRTC might want to consider ways that this huge national infrastructure could assist and improve the communication needs of our society. We would be pleased to share our research findings and recommendations with you once that ongoing work is completed and ask that you consider the reach of the national postal service when assessing the needs of Canadians in the area of communications. What do Canadians need from the telecommunications system? What are the basic services that Canadians require? Does this include broadband Internet? Is poor Internet service limiting your participation in the digital economy? Are there other barriers regarding telecommunications services that   are hindering your ability to participate in the digital economy? Is the CRTC’s / Mbps* target sufficient for Canadians to participate in the digital economy? Are some types of online activities difficult with a / Mbps connection? *In , the CRTC recognized that Internet services were   increasingly important and considered that it would be in the public   interest to establish universal target speeds of  megabits per second   (Mbps) downstream and  Mbps upstream for broadband Internet access in   Canada.

Bell has the most rural towers, and I do not believe enough companies are able to offer competititve service. Unless new technology is developed, I believe this new service by Bell is going to be the best service for those of us who are lucky to live close enough to one of their towers for the following reasons:    The Flex  plan provides enough fast internet service to accoomodate the needs of people who work online from home as well as those who wish to stream TV and movies.   The service seems to be reliable. I have not had an outage yet after four months. This is important for people who work online in fieds such as teaching.   The service is affordable. I have only recently noticed that my satellite provider is now offering  gigs a month for  dollars. People in rural areas want lots of gigs so that we can stream TV and access the Internet from ONE single provider at an affordble rate. It is true that some people may still wish to have satellite TV as a separate plan, but I do not perceive that to be the way into the future. I am also concerned that these new plans will evaporate as options once the hearings are over. Futhermore, regardless of how much affordable service the  satellite internet providers give us, speed will always be a major issue, not to mention the fact that there are constant connection issues.

However, any new   target must be set in accordance with our understanding and expectations of consumer   demand. After all, this is about consumers.

The Federal Communications   Commission has noted the difference between upholding universal service requirements   and monitoring the deployment of advanced telecommunications capabilities.  Taking   account of these differences ensures that any targets that are set for broadband funding   purposes maximize the benefits of limited resources without hindering the tremendous   strides that are made by industry when inspired by higher aspirational target speeds. In Canada, it is equally important to recognize these distinctions. Setting aspirational   speed targets creates an environment where competing technological platforms, spurred   on by ever-evolving consumer demand, are driven to extend advanced broadband   services to as many Canadian households as possible, with the Commission monitoring   the rate of progress along with changing consumer preferences. In contrast, setting speed requirements for any possible national contribution or other   regulatory funding program would serve a different purpose – namely achieving a basic   level of broadband access service. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services    . Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic   telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully   participate in the digital economy? As discussed more fully below, the regulatory category – “basic telecommunications   service” – presents challenges and limitations as a tool to determine which services are   necessary for Canadians to participate in the digital economy. Services that might have   been considered “basic” in the past are being eclipsed by new services and applications,   such as email, text messaging and even broadband Internet access services, that do not   easily fit within definitions and regulatory constructs that were created over  years ago. It also is important to consider the historical context in which these regulatory terms first   emerged. The term “basic telecommunications service” has a long history of use in   Canada and, for purposes of responding to this question, should be distinguished from the   term “basic service objective”. The former term (i.e., “basic telecommunications service”)   was first used by the Commission in  as a means of classifying a cross-section of   real-time, telecommunications services which, in the words of the Commission, provide a   “pure transmission capability over a communications path that is virtually transparent in                                                                    Ofcom, Universal Service Obligation: a review, , online at stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/uso/main/.

Taking these considerations into account, Shaw believes an obligation to provide a   particular telecommunications service should only be imposed where there is clear   evidence of market failure. c. What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should   these prices be determined? Market forces enable consumers to determine the optimal mix of value, quality, innovation   and service; therefore, they are the most appropriate mechanism for determining the price   of telecommunications services. Furthermore, market forces preserve the cycle of   investment, which is significant as network operators strive to compete and differentiate   themselves from their rivals, while meeting increasing demand for usage. Accordingly, where a service has been forborne from regulation (and is therefore subject   to competition sufficient to protect the interests of users), rates should be determined by   market forces. Can market forces and government funding be relied on to ensure that all   Canadians have access to basic telecommunications services? What are the roles   of the private sector and the various levels of government (federal, provincial,   territorial, and municipal) in ensuring that investment in telecommunications   infrastructure results in the availability of modern telecommunications services to   all Canadians?

Because these   satellites will operate in low earth orbit, they will not have any of the latency issues that are   experienced with the geosynchronous satellites that currently operate in the C, Ku and Ka   bands.    A. In the absence of a full technological assessment of the issue and the above-noted costing   information, it is difficult to comment on the questions posed above. However, in order to   be responsive to the Commission, Shaw submits that if it is determined that a mechanism   should be established to subsidize telecommunications modernization programs in the   North, such as through the use of contribution funds, this funding should be capped by the                                                                   The return of the satellite constellations, Space Review, March , , available online at   http://www.thespacereview.com/article//    http://www.thespacereview.com/article//     APPENDIX A   A-     amount that is currently used to subsidize residential primary exchange service in areas   where this subsidy is no longer required. Secondly, any recipients of funding for Northern   modernization programs should be required to participate in a competitive bidding process   in order to ensure that the lowest cost service provider is selected. See our response   below to Question . Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services    . What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic   service objective? The current definition of the basic service objective essentially captures a single service,   namely basic local voice telephony service. While Shaw does not object to the ongoing   inclusion of this service in the basic service objective, it is important to note that voice   services can be delivered using both circuit and packet switched technologies over a   variety of competing telecommunications networks, including conventional wireline   facilities, fixed wireless networks, terrestrial mobile or FSS and MSS satellite networks. Given the numerous technological changes that have taken place in the delivery of voice   telephony services over the past decade, the Commission should consider whether the   existing definition of the basic service objective takes proper account of these   developments. With respect to applying the basic service objective to other services, Shaw cautions   against applying this regulatory category – a holdover from a monopoly era with a single   telecommunications service – to broadband Internet access, a multi-dimensional and   highly dynamic service that has emerged and grown up in a much different competitive   landscape.

As discussed earlier, the Commission has forborne   from regulation in the vast majority of telecommunications services markets in Canada       APPENDIX A   A-     because these markets have been found to be subject to competition sufficient to protect   the interests of users. In these circumstances, it would not be efficient or proportionate to impose an obligation to   serve on a given service or service provider where market forces can ensure the   availability of competitive alternatives and practical substitutes. The Policy Direction   requires the Commission to rely on market forces to the maximum extent feasible and to   remove unnecessary regulation in competitive markets. This includes the elimination of the   obligation to serve in all markets that have been forborne from regulation. Taking the foregoing into account, Shaw recommends the elimination of the obligation to   serve in all markets where landline primary exchange service has been forborne from   regulation. Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications   service? What other services, if any, should be defined as basic   telecommunications services? Please see our responses to Questions  and  above. In addition, please note that simply   because a service has been classified as a “basic” service or forms part of the basic   service objective, does not mean that it should be subject to an obligation to serve or be   subsidized using funds from the national contribution fund. These are separate issues that   should be determined by other considerations, including most significantly whether the   service is provided in a market where competitive or practical substitutes exist. What resulting changes, if any, would be required to the existing regulatory   frameworks (e.g. As noted above, the existing national contribution regime is devoted almost exclusively to   the funding of a monopoly era service, namely wireline primary exchange voice services,   which is being rapidly substituted and replaced by other services and technologies (e.g.,   fixed and mobile wireless, mobile satellite, etc.).

As discussed in more detail above, the current target of  Mbps download and  Mbps  upload are utterly unreasonably low targets for Canadian’s access to the Internet. Canadians should have equitable access to  Gbps if we are going to compete with  other nations. However, as stated above, picking bandwidth targets is not an effective  way to develop broadband policy. This writer advocates for a more strategic approach  that sets standards of service, such as those spelled out in the guiding principles, which  are bandwidth target independent. The standards if mandated will drive innovation,  create competition, give consumers more choices, leading to better services and lower  prices. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic  telecommunications services   . It is the position of this writer that the CRTC mandate the delivery of equitable access to  broadband Internet to all Canadians as part of the basic service objective. As part of  this mandated service the CRTC must require ILECs, SILECs, and non-dominant  carriers to provide open access in a carrier neutral environment.

More competition will  provide consumers with more choices, leading to better services and lower prices.  Given that most users now rely on both fixed and mobile networks, depending on prices  and service quality they can obtain, the Commission should include both fixed and  mobile connectivity in the basic services framework. cable, digital subscriber line, fibre,  fixed wireless, mobile wireless, and satellite technology) should be a factor in defining  whether a telecommunications service should be considered a basic service.

More generally, lack of  access to fiber transport facilities represents a key problem in extending connectivity in  rural and remote communities. The Commission should impose third party access  obligations on transport facilities if it hopes to improve connectivity in rural communities  in a sustainable manner. It would have the effect of forcing incumbent telecom providers and other providers to  invest more in network facilities and equitably connect every Canadian resident,  business, and public sector site to fibre optic wireline and LTE wireless Internet services  and applications. Public subsidies are often required to improve the business case for  operators, but business operators have incentives to privatize the subsidies once they  have been allocated by closing the network to competition. Consequently, credible open  access standards such as those detailed above are critical for balancing these  contradictory incentives.      Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services   . It is the position of the writer that the CRTC mandate the delivery of equitable access to  broadband Internet to all Canadians as part of the basic service objective. Open access is  necessary to enable more applications and services competition. More competition will  provide consumers with more choices, leading to better services and lower prices. Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications  service? Fibre optic wireline and G/LTE wireless should be defined as basic service. Other  access media such as fixed wireless, copper, coax, and satellite should not satisfy the  definition of basic service and therefore not be eligible for funding. In other words, the  public sector should only invest in next generation technologies and implement policies  that encourage incumbent operators to decommission legacy network platforms. The main issues related to reviewing the contribution/local subsidy regime in the context  of including equitable access to broadband service as described above relate to the  requirement for a regulatory regime that would complement the inclusion of access to  fibre optic wireline and LTE wireless Internet service in an revised definition of basic  service. Since fibre optic wireline and LTE wireless is not currently equitably and  universally accessible, then the Commission should enhance the existing local subsidy  regime needs to address costs related to these services, as this will allow telecom  service providers to comply with requirements for equitable access.

If the definition of basic service is changed to include equitable access to the Internet,  then this may need to be phased-in over a period of time to enable telecom service  providers to plan accordingly. Moreover, the specification of carrier neutrality will require  fundamental changes to incumbent investment approaches that are based on market  dominance and regulatory forbearance and skewed toward retail services. The carrier  neutrality requirement will create a much more competitive wholesale marketplace  driving up service levels and driving down prices. Your response should address, with supporting rationale, which TSPs should be  required to contribute to the NCF, which revenues should be contribution-eligible and  which revenues, if any, should be excluded from the calculation of contribution-eligible  revenues. This writer has no response for this question. Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications  services be subsidized? Based on basic service being redefined as equitable access to fibre optic wireline and  G/LTE wireless service subsidies will be required as explained above. No other  access media, such as fixed wireless, copper, coax, and satellite, should be eligible for  subsidy as they will not meet the requirements for symmetry, QoS, scalability, and  equitability described throughout this response. This approach will help the Commission  design a forward looking regulatory framework that promotes technological change  required to deliver equitable access to reliable and affordable communications services  as mandated under Section  of the Telecommunications Act. Your response should address the mechanism described in Telecom Regulatory Policy  - for transport services and/or any other mechanism necessary to support  modern telecommunications services across Canada.

On behalf of EOWC and the communities we represent, I urge the Commission to consider our  needs and interest in this proceeding by adopting recommendations we have detailed in our   written submission and responses to interrogatories in this proceeding.

The vast majority of parties to this proceeding   and Canadians according to CRTC surveys agree with this recommendation. ) Include high-speed mobile broadband access services in the definition of basic  broadband services. Mobile network coverage and the availability of high-speed mobile data   services with minimum service quality guarantees are critical for communications between our   residents, visitors, and emergency service workers. This issue has not been discussed as   extensively as fixed broadband by other parties, but we hope the Commission recognizes its   importance for rural Canada. ) Mandate forward looking national standards. Existing “aspirational” speed targets were  inadequate when the Commission adopted them  years ago and remain so today.

What is achievable, however, is to provide a basic level of broadband connectivity to every Canadian household at a speed of /. What is crucial to recall is that we are seeking to define a basic level of service, and the evidence shows that a speed of / would fulfill that objective. As a comparison, when the basic level of service for wireline phones was first determined, it was one wireline connection per household – meaning that while multiple users could not use the device at the same time; every person in that household would nevertheless have access to basic wireline connectivity. Using wireline as the standard, establishing / as the basic broadband service would respect the principle of providing ubiquitous connectivity to all Canadians at a level of service that meets basic needs. It is once more worth noting that when setting the basic service requirement at speeds of /, we are discussing true / speeds, and not "up to" speeds. As such, we continue to recommend that the Commission establish a basic service speed of /. [bookmark: _Toc] Discussion of Bell's funding model  . As part of the Commission's oral hearing, we submitted a detailed cost analysis on the amount of funds that would be required to extend basic broadband service to the remaining % of Canadians. [footnoteRef:]  CRTC Exhibit  reveals that the cost of this extension is between $. to $. billion and that, as a result of government funding, private investment matching and a reallocation of voice subsidies, there is enough money in the system to finance the gap.

This percentage still falls below the  historical average from - of .%. In Summary:  Canadian farmers and rural communities continue to face significant constraints in accessing reliable and  adequate internet services. A lack of competition in many rural regions has left these regions with limited  options, disproportionate service costs, and an inability to achieve upload/download speeds that meet  even the minimum basic broadband service levels. As CFA identified in its previous submissions, this is  resulting in missed business opportunities, limiting access to uptake of technological innovations in the  industry, and ultimately undermining many farmers’ ability to participate meaningfully in the digital  economy. CFA has identified two important measures that would meaningfully contribute to reducing this service  gap by improving the level of basic broadband service across Canada and dedicating increased investment  to digital infrastructure deployment. These include:   . That the Commission set a goal of all Canadian households being able to access  Mbps  broadband internet service by  (the “ Mbps by ” goal), subject to annual updates to  the definition of “basic” broadband. That the Commission establish the Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism (BDFM), as  developed by Edgardo Sepulveda in the report entitled “Funding support for low-income  Canadians and Broadband Deployment” (see Appendix A for this report). In combination, these two measures would illustrate a commitment to improved rural internet service   delivery; begin to reduce the divide between urban and rural internet services, and ultimately position   Canadian agriculture to participate in a global agricultural marketplace that is increasingly reliant on   digital and on-line technologies. I do not want to appear at the public hearing. http://www.cfa-fca.ca/                                 APPENDIX A – Funding Support for low-income Canadians and   for Broadband Deployment, by Edgardo Sepulveda                             Funding support for low-income Canadians and for Broadband Deployment  Report for CRTC TNC -: Review of Basic Telecommunications Services  prepared for the  Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC)  on  July ,   by  Edgardo Sepulveda President, Sepulveda Consulting Inc.

                                                     . The purpose of this letter is to request the Commission to issue a letter notifying parties that the   provision of equal access as a wholesale service is not within the scope of the proceeding. In the   alternative, Yak requests that the Commission revise the schedule to permit parties, that are not   participating in the proceeding, to pose interrogatories and file comments. TNC - was issued on April , . Three and a half months later, the Commission issued   Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -, Review of wholesale wireline services and associated   policies. In it, the Commission noted that:       . Throughout the proceeding, almost all parties agreed that certain wholesale services that   support the public good, such as emergency and support structure services, as well as services   that support network interconnection, should generally be mandated"       . The Commission agrees with parties that wholesale services that serve the public good and   those related to network interconnection should be given special treatment for policy reasons   not captured by the Essentiality Test. (emphasis added). It has recently come to the attention of Yak Communications (Canada) Corp.

Yak does not believe that it was the Commission's intention to review equal access as a tariffed   wholesale service. If the Commission intended on such a review, it would have made the   language much clearer. Instead of noting that "basic service objective applies to the ILECs only in   local exchanges where the Commission continues to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions of   wireline local telephone services", TNC - would have identified conditions for the   provision of equal access. The Commission would have noted that access to the long distance network and the option for   competitive supply of long distance services is a requirement in all incumbent exchanges,   including those forborne from regulation. Furthermore, it would have been important to note   that making equal access available is a regulatory obligation imposed on CLECs in all exchanges,   except for small CLECs, classified as Type IV CLECs.  Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -, "Review of basic  telecommunications services", paragraph .   Ibid., paragraph . Exemptions for equal access is limited. In regards to Type IV CLECs, the Commission determined    that it would be "extremely difficult, if not impossible, for small CLECs to economically or   efficiently provision equal access".      . Bell suggests that these exemptions demonstrate the declining importance of equal access.    Yak submits that the Commission's decision is simply recognition of the fact that, in limited   circumstances, it is better to permit an exemption than prevent the use of a technology. Bell also says "VoIP soft switches are not designed by manufacturers to support Equal Access. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER f7b510e55a4f8455ff3f36ab00c36edb791fb649cd1f4fffb48b400465c89c5f

This area of growth isn't limited to entertainment based products and services; it also extends to  business and government oriented products and services such as on-line shopping, teleconferencing,  telecommuting, on-line education and government services. How can we possibly decide on a minimum level of service to satisfy our current data needs when it's  evident that it'll already be inadequate the day the decision is implemented? Instead, we should decide  on a target level of service that will give us plenty of room to support both our current and future data  needs for a very long time. I recommend this target be set at  Gbps symmetrical per household over fibre optics cable. This target must also become a condition for any entity wishing to receive government funding to help finance the  building or expansion of their network infrastructure. Government Funding  . On the subject of government funding, has anyone ever compared the amount of government money  the larger corporations are receiving to build and expand their networks against the amount of money  they're paying out to their directors and shareholders in the form of bonuses, stock options and  dividends? If a corporation is giving more money to their shareholders than it's receiving from the government,  does that mean all of the taxpayer's money the corporation has received is funding the lifestyles of the  corporation's shareholders? Why are we giving taxpayer money to large corporations that can finance  their own expansion projects with their existing profits? Commissioner Christopher MacDonald had asked me many questions about the funding for my  Community Network Initiative. I now recommend that we revoke the public funding given to  corporations that clearly don't need the money, and reallocate the funding to communities that will  benefit the most from building and leasing access to their own Last Mile network.

The Commission  . On April  , The Chair, Mr. Jean-Pierre Blais, delivered formal remarks during the course of the  hearing where he made the following statement (paragraph  of the transcript):  “Ladies and gentlemen, in light of all this, it strikes us that this proceeding launched over   months ago may very well be the last best chance to get it right. A chance to create  together a coherent national broadband strategy through an open and transparent process  based on evidence from all Canadians, achieve to the extent possible through consensus,  and implement it through shared responsibility.”  CRTC-- - Basic Telecom Services - Final Comments Page  of   http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/transcripts//tt.htm   . I must add that this proceeding may also be the last best chance for the Commission to demonstrate  their viability as a public organisation. During the last few years, many decisions released by the Commission appeared to be partial and  incomplete solutions to ongoing complex problems, with many decisions challenged or ridiculed by  large corporations. These challenges waste an enormous amount of time and money, denying many  Canadians access to improved telecommunications services at competitive prices.

The AAC (and, tangentially or more generically, certain other parties) have commented that the Commission should establish a subsidy for low-income customers to ensure they can have access to broadband services. We do not believe that the AAC has justified why such a fund is required. But even if there were a need for such a fund, Internet service providers (ISPs) should not be expected to subsidize low income Canadians' access to broadband – that is a role for the Government, not a regulatory issue. The AAC cites the Unites States' "Lifeline" project  as a basis for their recommended subsidy for low-income Canadians. While Republican Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Ajit Pai described the Lifeline program as "an open-ended, spendthrift entitlement,"  Senator Claire McCaskill, the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has also stated that "Lifeline's goal has always been admirable, but it was flawed from its inception and has since become one of the Government's most fraud-infested programs." .. Funding broadband service . In our view, the funding of broadband should be done through a transition of current contribution. Specifically, the Commission should fund  Mbps download and  Mbps upload (/) where / is not available. / would provide households more flexibility and also would ensure that deployment requirements are not met using legacy technologies that cannot be scaled at even higher speeds in the future should Canadians' needs increase in the future. With respect to which areas should be funded, we had originally proposed that any potential Commission funding be limited to Bands G and H given the lack of a viable business case to build broadband in these areas. In our view, this would signal to the Government which areas will be addressed by the Commission and which will not. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 90351b7922af16e524ff2dbaba03a37ce40d14fcdf5788c5dff3b4dbd3f1e0b1
A Government program (as opposed to a Commission-established subsidy) would be far less complex. It would not require a database to be implemented like NLAD in the United States given that subsidy would not go to ISPs in order to provide discounts. It could also leverage agencies which already have access to necessary tools for customer validation. And a simpler program would likely mean simpler record-keeping and auditing as well. For all of these reasons, we submit that the proposal for a Commission-established subsidy for low-income customers should be denied. . Where broadband service should be funded, and who should deploy it . Assuming that the Commission determines that it is necessary to establish a fund to support access to basic broadband services, the Commission will need to determine where this funding should be targeted, and who will have the obligation to deploy the infrastructure to be funded. As we noted above, the funding of broadband in a certain area is contingent on the Commission's determination that broadband is a basic telecommunications service in that area (in that funding is required for access to the service to be provided). In this regard, three different approaches have been proposed by parties in this proceeding. Namely, parties have argued that the Commission should declare broadband to be a basic telecommunications service:  · only in areas that require Commission-established funding;   · everywhere; and  · everywhere and on every provider. The first option is the one we recommend as it is consistent with the Act and allows the Commission to tailor any fund in a way that focuses on the areas that will be the most difficult to serve.

     contribution burden related to expansion of broadband networks ultimately borne by   Canadian telecommunications users, and ensure the maximum possible resources for   investment and innovation. In addition, recipients of broadband funding should be required to participate in a   competitive bidding process in order to ensure that the lowest cost service provider is   selected. The funding process should also be technology agnostic. This will ensure that   the widest range of networks and delivery technologies – including coaxial, fibre, hybrid,   satellite, fixed wireless or mobile wireless networks – is eligible for subsidy, provided they   meet the relevant service requirements. It will also ensure that the lowest cost, most   efficient option is selected, while preserving technological and competitive neutrality. The Basic Service Objective   . Several parties to the proceeding have recommended that the Basic Service Objective be   modified to reflect the current telecommunications market. Shaw supports proposals to   remove the obligation to provide Equal Access and a local telephone directory. With regard to Equal Access, Shaw concurs with Bell’s position, which it described in its   first intervention in the following terms:    Given the changing competitive and technological environment for voice services, we  recommend minor adjustments to the current BSO to eliminate the requirement to  provide Equal Access and access to dial-up services. These services made sense in  the old traditional (time-division multiplexing (TDM)) regime, but are no longer  applicable in the new Internet Protocol (IP) world. Demand for Equal Access is  extremely low given the multitude of alternatives available to consumers. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 56f94e0c99c273a4c68da74dadd7295f34dcfecba99a86ffe280e6b9a936e182
Using the requests for further   responses to RFIs portion of the proceeding to request this information is not the   proper forum in which parties may engage in these activities. Had OpenMedia wished to pose additional questions to the ISPs, as part of the   RFI process, it could have chosen to participate earlier in RFI processes which   were initiated on August , . However, OpenMedia chose not to engage   parties with RFIs until November , . OpenMedia chose to forgo earlier   engagement in the proceeding. The Commission should not now allow it to be   afforded the latitude to go beyond the bounds of procedure to attempt to engage   parties with additional questioning.    Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC- - Review of basic telecommunications services,   ( April ), at para . TELUS Communications Company  TNC -   December ,   Responses to request for disclosure      and further responses          . Should OpenMedia wish to rebut the responses provided by ISPs in response to   their November ,  RFIs, it is more appropriate for parties to make reply   comments in further interventions and at the Commission’s hearing. To allow   OpenMedia to make reply comments now would be prejudicial to TELUS and the   other ISPs, as it would allow one party to take an undue advantage of the process   outlined TNC CRTC -. Simply because a party chooses to make   comments at an inappropriate stage in proceedings, does not mean that the   Commission should allow such comments to stand. Rule (d) of the CRTC Rules permits the Commission to “order to be amended   or struck out a document or part of a document that, in its opinion might prejudice   a party or delay the hearing of the matter on the merits.”  Given that complete   disregard for procedure OpenMedia’s letter entails, the Commission must use its   powers under Rule (d) to strike this letter from the record.

  Namely Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications Partnership and TELUS Communications Company.   Regulatory framework for wholesale mobile wireless services, Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -,    May , at para .   The innovations of CNOC members are described at length in Part . of CNOC’s second intervention dated    June  in the Wireline Wholesale Review.      Importantly, independent service providers provide much higher value than just price discipline   on the incumbents; competitors are the key to sustainable competition, which is the only way to   mitigate the greatest barrier preventing Canadians from engaging the digital economy. It is therefore critical for the regulatory policy emanating from this proceeding to promote   competition in the provision of both wholesale and retail telecommunications services. . Target speeds for broadband Internet access service    . Setting a single universal speed target based on uses that consumers should reasonably   expect to make of the Internet is problematic. On one hand, the current  Mbps download and  Mbps upload speed target is not   sufficiently ambitious for many rural communities. Such communities should be striving for   greater speed targets and the next-generation applications that those speeds enable. On the other   hand, the current speed target is still very difficult to achieve in certain high-cost serving areas. Indeed, the Commission acknowledged this reality in Telecom Regulatory Policy -   (“TRP -”), noting that many communities in Canada, particularly (although not   exclusively) satellite-served communities, are facing challenges in achieving the Commission’s   broadband target.       . OBVIOUS_DELIMITER d9c68a76f3b3e03f518364265a04c0b2f544645601f0ada5904a65aa07a5aadb
CNOC expects to be in a better position to quantify minimum targets relating to service   speeds and other service characteristics (such as latency, jitter and packet loss) once it has had an   opportunity to collect additional data in this proceeding regarding the typical characteristics   associated with low, medium and high requirement broadband services/applications as defined in   section ., above. In addition, regardless of the minimum sets of characteristics required to support low,   medium and high requirement broadband services/applications, actual targets cannot be   established in the absence of an assessment of the funding requirements that would be required to   achieve the specified objectives. Therefore, CNOC will also be focusing on trying to have as much   data as possible placed on the record of this as proceeding as possible regarding the characteristics   of broadband services that can be supported at different levels of investment. As noted in section . below, government funding will be required to improve broadband   access for Canadians living in high-cost serving areas without generating any adverse impacts on   competition in the provision of telecommunications services. Once the amount of government   funding for broadband access in high-cost serving areas is established, corresponding performance   targets can be set based on the anticipated costs of achieving those targets. . THE COMMISSION’S ROLE REGARDING ACCESS TO BASIC  TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES     . Broadband Internet should be considered a basic telecommunications service    . Broadband Internet is firmly entrenched in the cultural and socio-economic fabric of   Canada. Accordingly, CNOC submits that broadband Internet should definitely be considered a   basic telecommunications service going forward. As such, broadband Internet ought to be   integrated in the basic service objective and government subsidies should be made available to   allow deployments in high-cost serving areas. As discussed in section . of this intervention, wireline networks have vastly superior   capabilities and characteristics than other telecommunication service platforms. For this reason,   the Commission should support cable, FTTN and FTTH builds in high-cost areas as a priority –   wherever it is economically efficient to build such networks. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER d9c68a76f3b3e03f518364265a04c0b2f544645601f0ada5904a65aa07a5aadb
  Digital Canada , <http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/.nsf/eng/.html>.      speed targets and potentially introduce new targets for other service characteristics, a staged   timeline for attaining such goals should track projected Federal Government funding. Provincial   and territorial governments wishing to make contributions could also do so whether through this   or other mechanisms, but the primary responsibility for the development of telecommunications   network infrastructure rests with the Federal Government, as it always has. Broadened redistribution of telecommunications service provider revenues through the   National Contribution Fund (“NCF”) is another tool that could, if necessary, assist the funding of   a subsidy regime for broadband Internet access deployment. As discussed in Section . below, a   great degree of caution should be exercised in relying on this approach in light of the significant   market distortions that could result from contribution obligations that are not appropriately   calibrated. . The Commission’s role in ensuring the availability of basic telecommunications  services     . If broadband Internet access is considered a basic telecommunications service, the   Commission’s primary role should be to identify high-cost serving areas that are eligible for   subsidies necessary for the deployment of network facilities. An important aspect of this   responsibility is also determining which network facilities are most suitable and economically   efficient for individual high-cost serving areas. As CNOC has argued, the Commission should   strive to enable wireline network builds (i.e. cable, FTTN, FTTH) wherever it is economically   feasible to do so. However, there will undoubtedly be many serving areas where wireline   deployments do not make sense for a number of reasons (e.g. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER d9c68a76f3b3e03f518364265a04c0b2f544645601f0ada5904a65aa07a5aadb
As noted in the JTF’s position paper that accompanies these answers to   the Commission’s questions, if a government or one of its agencies imposes an obligation   on the private sector such as building or augmenting a broadband network, this obligation   must be funded. Assuming that adequate subsidy funds are made available, the JTF would support   including broadband in the BSO and raising this target to  Mbps download and  Mbps   upload as a target to be achieved over the course of the next five years. CITC-JTF      Page      CRTC Question   Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic telecommunications  services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital  economy? cable, digital subscriber line,  fibre, fixed wireless, mobile wireless, and satellite technology) should be a factor in  defining whether a telecommunications service should be considered a basic  service. b) Identify, with supporting rationale, the terms, conditions, and service  characteristics under which basic telecommunications services should be provided. c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how  should these prices be determined? Answer  The JTF submits that voice telephony (including most of the features of the current BSO)   and a broadband circuit that delivers a specified set of characteristics, including a basic   capacity package, should be considered basic telecommunications services. a)  The JTF does not believe that underlying technology should be a factor in defining   whether a telecommunications service should be considered a basic service. Instead, it   should be the characteristics of the service that determines what is a basic service. For   example,  the current BSO includes the requirement for touch tone service regardless of   how that feature is provisioned. With regard to broadband services and regardless of how the service is delivered by the   underlying technology, the Commission should specify the upload and download speeds   as well as the tolerances for jitter and latency to ensure, once again, that Canadians are   able to meaningfully use the services provided.

To do this, Access  created MAC and bi-yearly elects MAC’s  board of directors.  Over the last  years, MAC has led Access  which consists of a  broad range of organizations, associations and individuals whose common goal  is to achieve the complete accessibility of Canada’s communications system for  Canadians with disabilities by .  Access  Group participants cross a diverse spectrum of Canadians  with disabilities to include a voice for blind and low vision, deaf and hard of  hearing, mobility, cognitive and intellectual disabilities, and includes, but is not  limited to National organizations such as March of Dimes, Easter Seals,  Canadian Council of the Blind, Disabled Women’s Network/ Réseau d’action des  femmes handicapées, Canadian Hearing Society and Canadian Hard of Hearing  Association.  Access  advocates policies that reflect the needs and concerns of all  Canadians who will benefit from accessing the Canadian broadcasting and  telecommunication systems. Underlying principles and objectives     After consultations and research with our constituency and the disability  community at large, we have adopted a set of underlying principles and  objectives that serve as the context through which we provide the Commission  with comment in this proceeding. They are:   • The CRTC basic services regulatory framework must provide  access to telecommunication services for all Canadians with  disabilities.  See MAC web site for partners, www.mediac.ca                                        MAC - The Access  Group of Accessibility Stakeholders                                                      • Canadians with disabilities represent .% of Canadian society  and have legal rights to have equivalent access to Canada’s entire  telecommunications system including voice, wireless and  broadband. • Canadians with disabilities should not have to pay for services they  cannot use due to their disability. • Canadians with disabilities have unique broadband needs that differ  from other Canadians which must be recognized in extending basic  service standards and or obligations to Internet access services. • Basic Internet access services must be provided at prices that are  affordable relative to average income of Canadians with disabilities. To ensure that Canadians with disabilities can afford connectivity,  the Commission and Industry Canada should develop a program  for subsiding broadband access to Canadians with disabilities that  cannot work or have low incomes.     MAC stakeholders recognize access to reliable and affordable Internet  access services of a high quality to be critical to the ability of Canadians with  disabilities to learn to overcome their unique challenges, build social network and  participate fully in the digital economy.

 Many service providers, particularly in urban areas advertise speeds over  Mbps download speed. Advertised  rates tend to be lower in rural areas. These rates specified on a “best effort” basis in advertisements and retail  contracts. As far as we are aware, there are no operators in Canada that offer quality of service guarantees to  households and smaller to medium sized businesses in the Canadian retail market.                                      MAC - The Access  Group of Accessibility Stakeholders                                                        Compliance and dispute processing: MAC/Access  stakeholders are  also in agreement that in addition to a funding mechanism, the Commission and  industry must develop more robust mechanisms for serving the unique and  rapidly growing need of those with disabilities for network access services. It is  important that, as a basic service, Canadians with disabilities have access to  expertise in telecommunications at the CRTC and from telecommunication  providers. A Disabilities Rights Office (DRO) would help educate public and  private sector stakeholders about disability issues assist the disabled with special  problem they can have communicating with service providers, and helping the  CCTS resolve disputes. The proposed DRO would help bridge the gap between  all stakeholders by shining a disabilities lens on telecommunications (and  broadcasting) policy issues to policymakers and service providers, as well as  helping resolve day-to-day problems that arise between Canadians with  disabilities and their service providers (e.g. mediating communications between  an individual with a disability and a customer service representative of a service  provider).  We hope the Commission will agree that our recommendations translate  into encouraging a wise investment in greater accessibility and inclusion for  everyone, but form part of a basic service framework for access to  telecommunications for Canadians with disabilities.  MAC on behalf of Access  would like to thank the Commission for  allowing them to participate in this public process.

Absent the changes proposed by CNOC to convert the   exemption into a deduction and increase the amount of the exemption to an amount that   is appropriate for current and expected market conditions, the negative impact on small   providers will increase significantly if the contribution revenue percentage increases as   is expected to be required to support the use of the NFC mechanism to subsidize   broadband Internet access deployment.

This proceeding is about ensuring Canadians have access to “basic telecommunications services”. The proceeding is not about ensuring all Canadians can access high-end telecommunications services.

 And it’s a benchmarking tool to give the minority of Canadians who don’t have that access, access to the basic level that the rest of Canadians have, rather than have the majority impose its values or its views on what he minority should be doing with the telecommunications service.  COMMISSIONER MacDONALD: And that’s a very fair statement. You know, it becomes challenging to determine whether watching a video on YouTube is educational and instructional or whether it’s entertainment. ] Regarding the need for basic broadband, the evidence supports a finding that broadband should be considered a basic telecommunications service. The Commission has recognized this. The question remains: What speed is “basic” broadband? Regarding affordability, the record indicates that many low income Canadians are struggling to afford essential telecommunications services. As the Chairperson said on behalf of entire Commission panel, “Clearly, the CRTC has work to do under its jurisdiction.”[footnoteRef:] The question is: What to do? Steps the Commission can take without delay   . The AAC’s high-level response is that question is the Commission must do something. The Commission has before it a considerable record containing extensive research on the Canadian telecommunications system, public opinion research, and direct evidence from numerous service providers, users, and public interest groups.

SaskTel submits that there is no need for the Commission to institute additional mechanisms in other areas of Canada. If the Commission were to develop such a mechanism, it is highly unlikely that a program developed to meet the needs of Northwestel’s operating territory would be appropriate. The current basic service objective consists of:  a) individual line local touch-tone service; b) capability to connect to the internet via low-speed data transmission at local rates; c) access to the long distance network, operator/directory assistance services, enhanced calling features and privacy protection features, emergency services, as well as voice message relay service;  d) a printed copy of the current local telephone directory upon request; e) unlimited local calling at a flat monthly rate, subject to a price ceiling; and f) access to a choice of long distance service provider. Certain components listed seem somewhat archaic, such as the references to touch-tone service, dial-up internet access and access to alternate long distance service providers. However, wireline voice is a gradually declining service, there is no pressing need to make changes to the BSO at this time. Only wireline voice should be considered a basic telecommunications service. Broadband services should not be considered basic telecommunications and, if they were, should only be considered basic telecommunications at a level required to deliver everyday broadband services. No other services should be defined as basic telecommunications service. No changes are required at this time. The local subsidy regime is gradually going away, but continues to provide an important social safety net for a significant segment of society. The collection mechanism is a known, effective methodology for supporting this regime. In addition, the methodology is also used to calculate the Telecom Fees. Therefore, disrupting the methodology of calculation of Contribution will also impact the Telecom Fee payments. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER f0993b1d5de98f12068c4d024185c63510287638fe5282b8dbbc1b0390624bef

In a  OECD paper   on the role governments should play in broadband, the authors argued that “most of the OECD  countries that lead broadband penetration, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Korea,  Sweden and Finland, have coherent broadband strategies.”  In Canada, a  report on broadband   development among the First Nations and Inuit communities states that: “Partnerships between  commercial, government, and First Nations and Inuit organizations are another core component of  broadband infrastructure and connectivity. To function most effectively, government policy designed to  support such partnerships recognizes the complex policy and funding environments that First Nations  and Inuit must negotiate, and be designed in a way that enables communities to partner to share  resources. This approach is necessary for communities and regions that cannot support an independent  business case for private­sector broadband development. Government policies designed to harness the  potential of advanced networks must be framed to support the endogenous development of  community­driven broadband infrastructure and connectivity models.” ​ ​These statements are as true for   most Canadian rural residents as they are for First Nations and Inuit communities: the federal,  municipal, and provincial governments need to work with commercial and community­led organizations  to ensure that everyone has access to the most advanced telecommunications infrastructure. What should be the Commission’s role in ensuring the availability of basic telecommunications  services to all Canadians? What action, if any, should the Commission take where Canadians do  not have access to telecommunications services that are considered to be basic services? As demonstrated in most parts of the world, without intervention, TSPs will only build where they can   make a profit. In Canada, for example, one of the major challenges of FTTP is the lack of incentive for  carriers to install fibre networks in rural communities, as long distances and low population density limits  their profitability. This has resulted in a digital divide between rural and urban regions and the existence  of service “donuts” ­ where a single TSP monopolizes (or hollows out) the profitable business centre of a  town, then neglects to extend their services to less profitable (residential) areas on the edge of town. Further, by focusing on the profitable businesses centres, this disincentivizes other TSPs from entering  the marketplace due to the limited number of customers in the area. The Commission’s direct mandate  is to take actions to ensure all Canadians have fair and equal access to telecommunications services  including broadband Internet.

The “net benefit” test includes the effect of investment on technological development and competition in   Canada, and the contribution to Canada’s ability to compete globally. In order to satisfy these criteria,  foreign investors can offer legally binding undertakings to demonstrate their “net benefit” to the country.

Cybera believes that transparency and the ability to see what customers are paying  for — versus what they are actually receiving — is important. Vertical integration is being heavily  pursued by ILECs, including new cloud and content offerings. In many cases, it allows for predatory  pricing in captive markets and an inability to determine what is actually being offered, and what are the  most beneficial services. It is imperative that TSPs are not able to inflate their costs or deflate their  revenues to manipulate subsidy contributions. In the interest of transparency, we believe that the  commission should regulate and require public disclosure of the cost of basic service and availability. Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications services be   subsidized?

Tim Wu, a Canadian who is now a Columbia Law School professor and expert on telecommunications,   frequently speaks about the need for government involvement in network infrastructure management:  “History shows that when a small group of private companies owns an essential part of the nation's  infrastructure, the potential for abuse is serious…That broadband has become a utility is obvious to  anyone.”      .

What is   Shaw’s view? If you agree, what, if any, download data usage cap target should the Commission   establish as part of the objective and why? ANSWER:       As we highlighted in our comments of  July , given the extremely broad and multifaceted   range in uses of broadband services and user preferences, defining a “basic” broadband Internet   service is a daunting challenge. In the current environment of varied consumer preferences and rapid technological change,   Shaw does not believe it is necessary or appropriate to include a data cap in the basic service   objective. However, if the Commission determines otherwise, we recommend that it first   determine what digital activities Canadians must be able to perform over the “basic” broadband   Internet service. Any data cap included in the basic service objective would allow for these   basic activities. From Shaw’s perspective the following functionalities are the most important to enable   meaningful participation in the digital economy and would therefore constitute “basic” Internet   activities:  the ability to send and receive e-mails, access online shopping, banking and   government resources, to stay on top of current events, participate in social media, make VoIP   and videoconferencing calls, and access educational, employment and health tools and   information. These “basic” activities that allow for participation in the digital economy can be   performed over a wide array of technologies, including cable, DSL, fibre, fixed wireless, mobile   wireless and satellite with service in the range of  Mbps downstream /  Kbps upstream and    GB of data per month.   Certain parties have identified broadband quality problems caused by factors such as   latency, jitter and packet loss as requiring attention in order to ensure the adequacy of a   broadband connection. Does Shaw agree, and if so, what quality standards would you   recommend and why? ANSWER:      Please refer to Shaw’s response to Shaw(CRTC)Aug-.

The Commission’s current target speeds,  megabits per second download   and  megabit per second upload, were relevant at the time of introduction in  May . Today, online services and applications that deliver high quality  streaming audio and video rely on faster connections. Several comparable  jurisdictions have recently adjusted their target speeds. The Commission  should consider similar target speed adjustments. The Commission should  also consider setting a quantifiable target level for monthly download  allowance to guide service providers’ overage usage charges. Broadband Internet access at the Commission’s target speeds should be   considered a basic telecommunications service. This could be accomplished  by adapting various components of the existing CRTC regulatory framework  used for wireline phone service, and the recent decisions and directions the  Commission has made in regional cases to the entire country. In considering an appropriate funding mechanism for areas in need of   broadband Internet within the country, the Commission should endeavour to  maximize consumer choice, affordability, and leverage market forces. Government of Ontario, Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure   Submission to Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -      Page  of       Answers to the Questions for Discussion     .

The Commission may also wish to consider adding a monthly download data  usage cap allowance target to its speed targets. Along with upload and  download target speeds, monthly download data usage cap allowances  represent a major quantifiable feature in a broadband subscription. Low- income consumers might subscribe to plans with low data cap allowances out  of necessity; these consumers might not be able to fully take advantage of  important online services for fear of exceeding their plan’s data usage  allowance. Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic  telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to  meaningfully participate in the digital economy? Ontario would encourage the Commission to consider the inclusion of   broadband Internet as a basic telecommunications service. The Commission  could use its own broadband target speeds to determine the threshold for  qualifying as true “broadband Internet.”       . As the breadth of online services continues to grow, the importance of having   a broadband connection to the Internet will intensify. By defining broadband Internet service as a basic telecommunications   service, the Commission would be stating that broadband Internet access is  at least as important as telephone service. Given the rapid convergence  between the traditional telephone system and the Internet, it will become  increasingly difficult for the CRTC and Canada’s service providers to separate  the two systems in the regulatory environment.

While not necessarily noticeable while using non-real-time or streaming  services, the delay can severely disrupt the quality of real-time services. In the Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC - (Northwestel Inc. –   Regulatory Framework, Modernization Plan, and related matters) decision,     Government of Ontario, Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure   Submission to Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -      Page  of       the Commission noted that “[satellite] services are generally more expensive  than terrestrial retail Internet rates for comparable speeds. Further, the  maximum speed for satellite retail Internet services is much lower than the  maximum speed for terrestrial retail Internet services.” Based on these  factors, the Commission decided that “satellite retail Internet services are not  substitutes for terrestrial retail Internet services.” We recommend that the  Commission continue to use its finding to state that “satellite retail Internet  services are in a different relevant product market than terrestrial retail  Internet services.”      b) Identify, with supporting rationale, the terms, conditions, and service  characteristics under which basic telecommunications services should be  provided. Ontario believes that the Commission should give consideration to an   appropriate consumer rights framework for broadband Internet service. In so  doing, the Commission may wish to review and adapt the consumer rights  established under Telecom Decision CRTC - (Statement of Consumer  Rights). c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and  how should these prices be determined? Provide rationale to support your  answer. The Commission should continue to abstain from regulating retail Internet   prices wherever possible with exceptions in situations that the Commission  deems necessary. Prices for basic telecommunication services should be fair, affordable and   determined by market forces. However, as the Commission has shown in its  decision in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC -, that there may be  circumstances in which certain retail Internet prices need to be regulated. These circumstances could include insufficient competition and relatively high  prices, particularly among underserved, unserved and some First Nations  communities.

The Commission should consider including broadband Internet service at   speeds of at least the Commission’s target speeds to be a basic  telecommunications service. Any changes to the local subsidy regime should be made with considerations   to current and future market forces, market failures, lack of competition and  the affordability of local services. The Commission decisions in Northwestel  such as transport facilities subsidy looks promising and should be explored  for adaption to other regions of the country. Should the Commission choose to establish a new funding mechanism for   areas in need, the existing contribution collection mechanism may require  appropriate modifications. Ontario would encourage the Commission to develop these modifications in  consultation with industry, governments and stakeholders. Broadband Internet as a basic telecommunications services should be   available to all Canadians for reasonable prices. A subsidy funding  mechanism may be required to make this happen. Ontario would encourage the Commission to develop these mechanisms in   consultation with industry, governments and stakeholders. The Commission should continue to monitor retail Internet prices and act, as   necessary, to ensure that rates are reasonable. In markets where the  Commission determines that it can no longer refrain from regulating rates, it  should step in to regulate following its policy directions.

As a result, we commonly hear from members that they are unable to determine where they can connect to or actually gain access to broadband transport. In our written submission, we cited specific cases that, taken together, show a wide variance in the pricing of access to fibre backhaul depending on a member’s geographic location and the incumbent from whom they must purchase the service. Those questions of access to and pricing of broadband transport remain our over-riding concern in this proceeding. If our members are to upgrade and extend their broadband networks, there must be some mechanism to ensure that they can secure fair, consistent and reasonable access to and pricing of transport services. In response to other parties’ written submissions and to respond to the Commission’s questions in the public notice, we will offer our comments on:  · definition of the Basic Service Objective, including broadband;  · cost-effective access to broadband fibre transport facilities; and · contribution and subsidy mechanisms. Definition of the Basic Service  . Many commenters support the premise that some level of broadband connectivity is essential to the use, by Canadians, of a broad range of on-line health, education, commerce, government services and personal communications. In addition, availability of broadband service is a critical enabler of small business activities in communities throughout the country. The existing Mbps downstream /  Mbps up speed targets previously set by the Commission already are being overtaken by the bandwidth demands of available applications. The / minimum may, at this time, remain appropriate for certain remote areas for which wireline networks may never be an economically possible solution. Otherwise, the targets, should be more in the order of  downstream and  up. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 1eb75bfeebfc5dec16ac77dbd162879ef4df6eee2af3fcd07bc1bad37fd5b4f8

This proceeding is about the “basic” level of telecommunications service all   Canadians can expect to have access to. But this proceeding is not about today, nor   is it about the past. This proceeding really is about tomorrow. This proceeding is also about inclusiveness – including all Canadians in the digital   economy through universal service. By definition “all Canadians” must include   Canadians living in the North and outside of urban areas, and Canadians of all   origins, ages and incomes. Given the complexity of the issues raised in this proceeding, the AAC has reduced its   position to the following nine key positions.

The AAC does not believe there will be much debate over the proposition that   broadband has become an essential service, if not the essential telecommunications   service, from the perspective of all Canadians. Indeed, access to the Internet is gaining recognition as a human right. To underscore the point that broadband Internet service has become an essential   telecommunications service, if not the essential telecommunications service, the   AAC presents primary and secondary evidence to demonstrate how essential – how   vital – broadband Internet is to all Canadians. From a human rights perspective to a   national economic competitiveness standpoint, Canada must make universal   broadband access a priority. The importance of Internet access to Canadians is borne out by the results of the   Environics survey. It follows that if broadband has become an essential telecommunications service, if   not the essential telecommunications service, then all Canadians should have   access to at least a “basic” level of service. This is currently what Canadians expect   of their telephone service. Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Executive Summary             Key Position . Not all Canadians are able to connect: access and socio- economic barriers persist. Access to broadband has two components: availability and affordability. If one   cannot make the connection to the network, physically, no amount of money will   solve that problem, whereas connection may be possible, but at an unaffordable   level.

The minimum “basic” requirement for Internet access speeds today (based on likely   out of date  data) is at least  Mbps per household, but the updated number is   expected to be approximately  Mbps - double the  Mbps target set in the    BSO. The AAC expects the “basic” level of broadband available and used by most   Canadians to be at least  Mbps by , and therefore the Commission should set   that as the universal service objective for broadband, subject to yearly updates. Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Executive Summary          Key Position . To support the “ Mbps by ” goal, the Commission should  establish a new funding mechanism, financed through the  existing but modified National Contribution Fund, to supplement  the current residential local wireline subsidy regime, which  would continue to operate as is. The new Broadband Deployment  Funding Mechanism would be to support broadband  deployment. Funding, which would be capped annually, could be  achieved through broadening the contribution-eligible “tax base”  by including retail Internet and paging service revenues, and by  returning the contribution rate to historic (-) levels. The  Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism could be  implemented beginning . To support the goal of ensuring that all Canadians are able to have access to “basic”   telecommunications services, and particularly broadband home Internet service, the   AAC is proposing a new funding mechanism – the “Broadband Deployment Funding   Mechanism”, as developed by Edgardo Sepulveda, an expert in universal service   regimes. The new Broadband Deployment Funding Mechanism could be funded through an   increase to contributions to the National Contribution Fund (“NCF”), which is   reasonable given that the current NCF is small and has decreased significantly in   recent years, even as telecommunications service revenues have increased. The NCF contribution regime could be expanded to include revenues from certain   currently exempted services (retail Internet and paging), and by returning the   contribution rate to historic levels.

As the Chairman   said about broadcasting, we as Canadians are now at a “fork in the road” and we can   choose the status quo, or go down a less familiar path. In the result, the                                                       John Lawford & Alysia Lau, “No Consumer Left Behind: A Canadian Affordability Framework for   Communications Services in a Digital Age” (January ), online: <http://www.piac.ca/wp- content/uploads///PIAC-No-Consumer-Left-Behind-Final-Report-English.pdf> (“Appendix  “C”, PIAC’s Affordability Report”)      Speech, “Jean-Pierre Blais to the Canadian Club of Ottawa on Let’s Talk TV and the future of  content made by Canadians” ( March ):   We are now at a fork in the road. We can choose the status quo which has as a lynchpin a  vision of the television media as being essentially linear. That path is known, it is tested;  but it does not prepare us for the inevitable future – one that is wholly viewer centric. Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       Commission went down a less familiar path, initiating a sweeping set of perhaps   painful but necessary reforms to the way broadcasting is regulated, and to the   expectations placed on large broadcasters who were in need of inspiration and   motivation from the CRTC to adapt to inevitable change. So now, having also undertaken major framework reviews of wholesale wireline and   wholesale wireless services – frameworks which set new ground rules for   competition – the Commission has turned its focus on the end user: Canadians. What do Canadians need? What do Canadians expect? How can the   Commission help? The task the Commission faced in Let’s Talk TV – reforming a system that was   broken, anachronistic, and out-of-touch with consumer needs and the broader public   interest – in some way parallels the challenge of updating universal   telecommunications in Canada and including broadband access in that “basic”   service. Just as Let’s Talk TV was about all Canadians, so too is this proceeding. This   proceeding is about inclusiveness – including all Canadians in the digital economy   through universal service.

Today, participation in the   digital economy is essential to civic involvement and to everyday life. This means   that Canadians need more from their telecommunications services than ever before. In order to enable Canadians to meaningfully participate in this evolved, more   intense, and more interactive digital economy, broadband service at a speed of at   least  Mbps today (based on likely outdated  information) and more likely to be    Mbps, must be recognized by the Commission as a “basic telecommunications   service”. This service must be accessible and affordable to both urban and rural   Canadians. The service level must evolve as technology evolves and more and more   Canadians are able to access higher speeds. The AAC expects that “basic”   broadband will be  Mbps by . The BSO should be upgraded to include   recognition that all Canadians should have access to basic broadband, as defined by   the Commission, updated on a yearly basis. The BSO should continue to include   access to voice services. The Commission should consider both voice and broadband services as basic   telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully   participate in the digital economy. “Voice” service could be provided by either   wireline or wireless service. As the Affordable Access Coalition explained above in response to Consultation   Question (a) and (b), in about  years the term “digital economy” has moved from   describing an avenue of business to enabling the everyday lives of Canadians. As described in the AAC’s response to Consultation Question (b) above, Canadians   increasingly require higher-quality telecommunications services to fulfill their needs   in the modern digital economy. Broadband Internet is now a critical service that the   Commission must include as a “basic telecommunications service.” In response to   Consultation Question (b) below, the AAC describes how the legal test for   determining what is a “basic” telecommunications service, results in a finding, using    data that is likely out of date, that “basic” broadband is at least  Mbps     Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       download speeds, but more likely to be  Mbps today, and expected to be  Mbps   by .

As described in the AAC’s response to Consultation Question (b) above, Canadians   increasingly require higher-quality telecommunications services to fulfill their needs   in the modern digital economy. Broadband Internet is now a critical service that the   Commission must include as a “basic telecommunications service.” In response to   Consultation Question (b) below, the AAC describes how the legal test for   determining what is a “basic” telecommunications service, results in a finding, using    data that is likely out of date, that “basic” broadband is at least  Mbps     Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       download speeds, but more likely to be  Mbps today, and expected to be  Mbps   by . Few would take issue with the need of Canadians to access wireline telephony   services. In a similar fashion, a network originally established to enable wireline   service is now viewed by a large majority of Canadians as being essential, and   worthy of funding support. In terms of performance measures, these are addressed extensively in response to   Consultation Question (b) above. What are considered affordable rates for broadband services? In January , PIAC reported on its investigation on the development of a   framework for defining affordability of communications services in the digital age. In   this study, PIAC concluded that each communication service (broadcasting, wireline,   wireless and Internet) was critical for different groups of consumers. Many who   subscribed to home Internet service were extremely reluctant to cancel the service,   coming to rely upon it to conduct day-to-day activities, with families with   schoolchildren facing pressure to have home Internet access.        . PIAC concluded that affordability is both a qualitative and quantitative measurement. In quantitative terms, PIAC suggested communications services are affordable   where, as a guideline, they make up about % to % of a household’s income.   Since affordability is related to the ability of an individual or a household to control   their expenditure in order to fulfill their needs, PIAC contends a qualitative   measurement must be taken into consideration. PIAC concluded a qualitative   assessment of the affordability of a communications service must examine:       Cost of each individual communications service, as well as the group of   communications services as a whole;    Total cost of ownership, including the cost of credit, rather than merely the   monthly service cost;    A service offering which at minimum – to the extent that technology allows –   enables a low-income individual to fulfill the four core functions of   communications services: (i) voice communication; (ii) readily available                                                        Appendix “C”, PIAC’s Affordability Report at iii.

Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       relationship between wireless service and broadcasting, wireline and broadband in   Canada. Now wireless service in Canada can harness the other three   communications services offered to Canadians from the palm of their collective   hands. However, the enhanced position of wireless service in relation to   broadcasting and wireline service is directly dependent upon the use of broadband   data. As a result, the AAC contends the interdependent relationship occurring between   wireline, broadcasting, wireless and broadband services can displayed as follows:         Figure . The interdependent relationship of communication services in Canada   . Therefore, the AAC requests that the Commission to consider access to broadband   as a basic telecommunications service necessary for Canadians to be able to   meaningfully participate in the digital economy. Access to the Internet at a sufficient   speed is increasingly becoming the tie that binds the other communications services   depicted above. Ideally, the underlying technology should not be a factor in defining whether a   telecommunications service should be considered a “basic telecommunications service”. Canadians should be allowed to choose the service or services they prefer, from a range   of competitive service providers, based on what is available and the price of those   services. Additionally, and in keeping with the Telecommunications Act policy objective   of ensuring all Canadians have access to “high quality” telecommunications services,   there must be a defined quality standard.                                                           Telecommunications Act, section (b). The definition of basic telecommunications services should therefore in principle be   technology neutral and deliver a prescribed level of functionality and quality and, ideally,   consumer choice. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 423ae225a9157b399631d6376c859df830b6c9b3a6b0f6eb1ef1b722f099a539
Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       Universal Service and the Definition of Basic Telecommunications Services      . Consultation Question (b) asks about the service characteristics of “basic   telecommunications services”. Such a discussion is fruitless, if not impossible,   without a definition of “basic telecommunications services”. The AAC believes that “basic telecommunications services” should be defined as   follows:      “Basic telecommunications services” are those   telecommunications services (as defined by the   Telecommunications Act) that permit Canadians to   access emergency services, government services   and other essential public services and to   communicate with each other, with businesses and   with others in Canada and throughout the world via   any commonly used form or protocol”. “Commonly   used” means used by more than % of the   households in Canada and by % of households   using that particular telecommunications service. The AAC’s definition of “basic telecommunications services”   . To explain this definition, the AAC unpacks the assumptions behind it and the   assumptions behind Consultation Question (b). “Basic telecommunications services” is not defined in the Telecommunications Act. The only two references to “basic telecommunications services” (plural) are in   section ’s definition of “telecommunications service provider” which is defined as: “a   person who provides basic telecommunications services, including by exempt   transmission apparatus”, and in subsection .() of the Telecommunications Act:      Contribution to fund      . () The Commission may require any telecommunications service provider   to contribute, subject to any conditions that the Commission may set, to a fund to   support continuing access by Canadians to basic telecommunications   services. There is one further reference to “basic telecommunications service” in section  of   the Act, which permits the Commission to treat the earnings of an “integral” affiliate     Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       as earnings of a Canadian carrier where necessary to set or approve just and   reasonable rates. This is thin gruel from which to build a definition of the term “basic   telecommunications services.”      . The AAC submits, therefore, that it is appropriate to seek the definition in the   decisions of the Commission, of Canadian courts and, where appropriate, to draw   inspiration from foreign legal regimes, especially comparable legal systems such as   those in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. The AAC notes that the Commission has discussed “basic telecommunications   services” in several decisions. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 423ae225a9157b399631d6376c859df830b6c9b3a6b0f6eb1ef1b722f099a539
() SPECIFIC AND PREDICTABLE SUPPORT MECHANISMS.—There should  be specific, predictable and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve  and advance universal service. () ACCESS TO ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR  SCHOOLS, HEALTH CARE, AND LIBRARIES.--Elementary and secondary  schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should have access  to advanced telecommunications services as described in subsection (h). () ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES.--Such other principles as the Joint Board and the  Commission determine are necessary and appropriate for the protection of the  public interest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent with this Act. Consultation Question (b) asks for “the terms, conditions, and service   characteristics under which basic telecommunications services should be provided.”      . The AAC largely draw their answer from §(b) of the U.S. universal service   obligation. The basic telecommunications services characteristics should be:      . Universality – all Canadians should benefit from the following service   characteristics:   . Accessibility – have access to high quality telecommunications;   . Affordability – be able to afford basic telecommunications; and   . Equity – no matter where they reside in Canada should be able to subscribe   to and fully use a comparable level of basic telecommunications. Based on the foregoing, the AAC next considers the definition of what is the subject   of the above section, namely: What legally are “basic telecommunications services”,   or as stated in Consultation Question (b), and What are the “terms and conditions”? The AAC notes that again, the U.S. regime supplies an answer by detailing “the   services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms” are   found in §(c)():     Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       ()  In general     Universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services that the  Commission shall establish periodically under this section, taking into account  advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services. The  Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the definition  of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support  mechanisms shall consider the extent to which such telecommunications  services—    (A) are essential to education, public health, or public safety;   (B) have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been  subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers;   (C) are being deployed in public telecommunications networks by  telecommunications carriers; and   (D) are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity. From this list, the AAC note that, apart from social and public interest considerations   (which are considerable, but variable and not determinative according to the view of   the decision-maker) that the factors (b) and (c) are capable of verification and   quantification.      .

Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       neighbourhoods in major cities) but may be ignored by all carriers. The consequence   of such a decree would be to empower any individual unable to obtain service from a   carrier operating with service lines in their area to then to bring a complaint to the   CRTC with the expectation that the CRTC could then issue an order to that carrier to   provide service to that customer. Further, as developed elsewhere in the AAC’s intervention, the two new funding   mechanisms to support the provision of telecommunications service – the proposed   Affordability Funding Mechanism and the proposed Broadband Deployment Funding   Mechanism (described in response to Consultation Question  below) – would   support the economical delivery and purchasing of service to underserved and   unnerved households, which carriers might otherwise wish to avoid – for example; if   lack of service was relating to perceived “quality of customers” within the carrier’s   service area. Regarding jurisdiction to impose this OTS in a forborne environment, the content of   the OTS would most likely be encapsulated in Commission conditions on service   under section  of the Telecommunications Act and the unjust discrimination   provision (subsection ()), with reference to the policy objectives in subsections   (a), (b), (g) and (i). In relation to rate regulated primary exchange service   (“PES”), such as in high-cost serving areas (“HCSAs”) not forborne, and for   standalone PES in forborne (voice) exchanges, additional content relating to the   OTS would be found in the relevant tariffs (promulgated under the Commission’s   rate-setting and tariffing jurisdiction under section  and subsection ()). What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should   these prices be determined? Brief answer: Cost consistently surfaces as a critical factor which determines a   citizen’s willingness to subscribe to a telecom service (several studies cited). On one   hand, the AAC has proposed creating a fund for low-income Canadian users. If the   Commission also chooses to focus on the price of basic telecom services, then the   AAC proposes that the Commission consider the following elements:      a) Consumer control: Consumers’ views on what they should or would like to pay for   basic service;   b) Consumer need: The maximum amount which consumers are able to pay for a   service. This factor is only one aspect of affordability and better reflects consumer   views on the importance of a service;     Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       c) Consumer willingness to pay: Research on ranges in prices which consumers are   willing to pay for a specific service;   d) “Inexperienced users” or non-adopters are typically willing to pay less than   experienced users to subscribe to a telecom service; and   e) The service provider’s costs for providing a service. The AAC first notes that it is not advocating, at this time, for price regulation of basic   telecommunications services. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 423ae225a9157b399631d6376c859df830b6c9b3a6b0f6eb1ef1b722f099a539
Brief answer: The BSO should be continued for voice but should now include   broadband with a reasonable data allowance. The obligation to serve should be   formally stated to be applicable to all Canadian carriers in their service territories   along lines of supply (wireline) or within present range of transmission (wireless). The AAC has addressed this Consultation Question in the context of a broader   treatment of the BSO in response to Consultation Question (b) and Consultation   Question  above. In sum, the next BSO should continue to include voice and also be upgraded to   include “basic” broadband, as defined in relation to the - rule (when % of the   population access the Internet via broadband and of those % at the specified   speed) with a reasonable data allowance. The obligation to serve should be formally stated to be applicable to all Canadian   carriers in their service territories along lines of supply (wireline) or within present   range of transmission (wireless). What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications   services? Brief answer: There is no question that broadband Internet service should be   defined as a “basic” telecommunications service, and that the BSO be upgraded to   include access to broadband. Ongoing access to voice (wireless, wireline or VoIP)   should also continue to be part of the definition of basic telecommunications   services. As the AAC explained in response to Consultation Question (b) above, broadband   Internet has become a critical service to fulfill Canadians’ social, economic and   cultural needs today. The Commission and individual Commissioners have   previously stated their recognition of this fact, as has the Government of Canada in     Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC -  Phase  Intervention of the Affordable Access Coalition    July            Page  of       the Digital Canada  strategy. The importance of Internet access and the   applications it makes available in modern society today necessitates that broadband   Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service.

[footnoteRef:] [:  As explained in the CRTC Communications Monitoring Report , page : “A managed line refers to telephone service which uses a local service provider’s network, and the provider has control over call quality. A non-managed line refers to telephone service that is provided using the public Internet, with the local service provider having less control over the quality of service. This type of local service is referred to as access–independent VoIP.”]  [:  CRTC, Communications Monitoring Report , page .] Clearly, it is the functionalities provided by the voice service that is important for consumers rather than the underlying technology. In summary, not only is the wireline primary exchange service (PES) provided by the ILECs no longer universally used by Canadians as their main local voice service, but mobile wireless services, access-dependent VoIP services and access-independent VoIP services are now largely considered and used as practical alternatives by Canadians. Broadband service availability . In fact, as a result of network deployments initiated by TSPs and support of the Government’s Connecting Canadians program, over  percent of Canadian households, compared to % in [footnoteRef:], will be able to subscribe to high-speed Internet at the current Commission target speeds of  Mbps based on different technologies by . [:  CRTC, Communications Monitoring Report , Figure .. ]   . Moreover, driven by market forces, it is noticeable that the availability of broadband service at higher speeds, excluding satellite and mobile wireless technologies, has been expanding during over the years. [footnoteRef:]    [:   Ibid. ] That said, the competitive capacity of the mobile wireless and satellite technologies cannot be ignored.

According to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, reported in a document entitled “Home Broadband ”,  December , the same phenomenon is identified in the United States: “Today smartphone adoption has reached parity with home broadband adoption (% of Americans now report that they own a smartphone), and % of Americans are “smartphone-only” – up from % in . Some of the most significant changes in these adoption patterns are taking place among African Americans, those with relatively low household incomes and those living in rural areas.” http://www.pewinternet.org////home-broadband-/]   . In summary, driven by competitive pressures and supported by government funding, the choice of broadband speed has greatly expanded in Canada during the last five years. Not only will most Canadian households soon have access to the current / Mbps target speed established by the Commission, but several higher speeds of wireline and wireless Internet services are now offered and largely available in the Canadian market. No doubt, this trend will continue to grow during the next five years. Redefining the basic telecommunications services objective and its application . As described above, the highly dynamic competitive market environment and the evolution of wireline, wireless and satellite telecommunications technologies have made available a large diversity of telephony and broadband services in the Canadian market. Taking into account this market reality, Cogeco remains of the view that the Commission's regulatory framework should continue to be cognizant of the fact that most Canadians have the possibility of exercising choice in the current context among several telephony and broadband services available from competitive TSPs to support their diversified basic telecommunications needs. Redefining the basic service objective (BSO) . In this perspective, Cogeco submits that the main purpose of the BSO is, first, to determine the minimum level of basic telecommunications services that should be available to Canadians throughout the country and, secondly, to determine whether the attainment of this objective requires the adoption of specific regulatory measures, mainly the allocation of subsidies by the NCF. Cogeco believes that voice and broadband Internet access services will continue to be the foundation for meaningful participation by Canadians in the digital economy in the foreseeable future and therefore agrees that the current definition of the BSO should be revised. Accordingly, Cogeco supports the inclusion of the broadband access service at / Mbps in the definition of the BSO for the next five years, along with a revision of basic voice service components. The inclusion in the BSO of the broadband access service at the current target speed of / Mbps would thus replace the current requirement of the BSO to provide access to the Internet via a dial-up connection at low-speed data transmission. Cogeco shares the view expressed by other interveners that the / Mbps is still sufficient to meet the minimum basic Internet needs to allow participation in the digital economy.

In TRP -, while relying on market forces and targeted government funding for broadband service deployment, the Commission found that it would be in the public interest to establish universal target speeds for broadband Internet access in Canada. Accordingly, it established target speeds of  Mbps download and  Mbps upload, which it expected should be available to all Canadians, through a variety of technologies, by the end of . As a result, by , over % of Canadian households will have access to a broadband service of / Mbps, representing an additional % of households to the percentage identified in . While Cogeco considers that the /Mbps speed is certainly sufficient to meet the current basic broadband needs of many Canadians, as underscored by several interveners in this proceeding and evidenced by the fact that a large proportion of Canadians still had such an Internet connection speed in [footnoteRef:], Cogeco believes that such an upgrade would provide an appropriate goal to meet the minimum Internet needs of Canadians by the end of the next five years. This upgrade of the national target speed to / Mbps is proposed in recognition of the ever-increasing demand for faster speeds over the last few years caused by the popularity of video streaming and the multiplication of connected devices on the same Internet connection. [:  .% of Canadian households had an Internet connection speeds between  and  Mbps. CRTC, Communications Monitoring Report , Table ... ] [footnoteRef:] [:  See FCC -,  December , and the news release entitled “FCC Increases Rural Broadband Speeds Under Connect America Fund”: https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-rural-broadband-speeds-under-connect-america-fund ]   . Thus, by including an Internet connectivity of / Mbps in the BSO and by establishing at / Mbps the new national target speed, the Commission would provide new benchmarks for funding initiatives. Finally, while it is not opposed in principle to the adoption of an aspirational target speed as suggested by other interveners, Cogeco does not believe that the Commission needs to establish a forward-looking target speed for evaluating whether advanced broadband is being deployed to all Canadians in a timely manner. As evidenced by the current trend and suggested by many forecasts, the intensity of consumer demand for broadband services at higher speeds will continue to exercise pressures on wireline and wireless carriers to constantly upgrade their networks and meet the evolving service demands of their residential and business customers.

There appears to be a tendency among some industry interventions, especially  among parties not operating in the North, to be overly optimistic about the power  of market forces and the potential of new technologies, coupled with a dismissal  of government intervention or subsidies as “a blunt instrument”. NBDC insists  that the financial interests of industry must be balanced with public interest and a  modern interpretation of the Telecommunications Act. Canada has made a national commitment under Section  of the  Telecommunications Act to ensure that high quality, reliable and affordable     	         	                                    www.nunavut-broadband.ca         telecommunications services are “accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural  areas in all regions of Canada”. The problem is that the current interpretation of “telecommunications services”  only includes landline telephone and dial-up internet access. Does a $ million  annual subsidy for landline voice and dial-up internet access make sense in ? Should broadband internet access be included in the definition of basic  telecommunications services and supported accordingly? So who pays for it and what do you pay for, exactly? There are a few things to take into consideration. Data from the Communications Monitoring Reports and the EKOS study highlight  the increased reliance on and expectation of ubiquitous broadband and mobility. We need to look ahead and support access to the entire telecommunications  basket. Users want to go seamlessly from device to device, in the home, at work  and on the move.

The bottleneck for Nunavut is backbone and that cannot be solved with a  fragmented approach where services for consumers are supported separately  from services for business or government. All Nunavut users rely on the same  upstream services delivered over the same (inadequate) infrastructure – legacy  satellite. The North needs fibre. CRTC's own satellite inquiry clearly concluded that HTS will  not meet the North's needs and that we will continue to be reliant on legacy  satellite services of limited capacity and high cost. The federal government should designate one point of contact for Arctic  broadband policy. Is it the CRTC? Is it Industry Canada? Is it Infrastructure  Canada? NBDC has dealt with all of the above. NBDC respectfully     	         	                                    www.nunavut-broadband.ca         submits that one federal entity needs to take the lead and coordinate a coherent  Arctic broadband strategy to chart a clear way forward for fibre. The Commission is best placed to take on this role because the CRTC is not as  susceptible to political pressures and election cycles.

Conclusion .........................................................................................................................            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   ES. The record reflects a resounding consensus on the importance of broadband access. These   services must now be considered basic telecommunications services. The ‘needs’ of Canadians include, but are by no means limited to, email, e-commerce,   banking, news, social media, VoIP, video-conferencing, telework, distance education, telehealth,   access to educational and government tools and certain accessibility features like Video Relay   Service. The basic service objective must be defined appropriately to ensure that Canadians have   access to these ‘needs’. CNOC submits that  Mbps D /  Mbps U is an appropriate speed target which provides   adequate capacity for practical everyday use of ‘needs’ applications. In contrast, continued reliance   on the current  Mbps D /  Mbps U target will not provide sufficient capacity to accommodate   the evolving technical demands of basic broadband uses. A lower, yet still practical, speed target may be required for high-cost terrestrial and   satellite serving areas where  Mbps D /  Mpbs U is unattainable.

The Commission also has jurisdiction to order   either the upgrade or construction of new facilities based on subsections () and () of the Act. CNOC has provided more detailed submissions concerning questions of the Commission’s   jurisdictional authority and correspondinglimits by way of the following responses to Commission   issued requests for information (“RFIs”): CNOC(CRTC)Apr- and CNOC(CRTC)Apr-  . . Structure of Submission    . This final argument is structured as follows:    • Part . of the submission characterizes broadband as an essential service and draws a   distinction between the ‘needs’ and ‘wants’ of Canadians;   • Part . makes recommendations with respect to speed targets and other service   characteristics that should be reflected in the basic service objective;   • Part . of the submission outlines CNOC’s views on how to develop and engage a   national broadband strategy;   • Part . sets out CNOC’s views as to how the national broadband strategy should be   funded;    • Part . addresses affordability concerns;                                                                 Telecommunications Act, S.C. , c. .    • Part . underlines the importance of prioritizing the most cost-effective   telecommunications service platforms;   • Part . proposes terms that must be associated with the subsidized provision of   broadband Internet as a basic telecommunications service;   • Part . includes CNOC’s recommendations relating to the existing local services   framework;   • Part . contains CNOC’s submissions with respect to special regulatory measures   that are required in the serving territory of Northwestel Inc. (“Northwestel”);   • Part . sets out proposed changes to the current contribution framework;    • Part . addresses the need for discoverability of transport facilities and a review of   the forbearance regime for inter-exchange transport;    • Part . discusses digital literacy; and   • Part . provides CNOC’s conclusions. . Broadband is a Basic Telecommunications Service    . The record of the proceeding reflects a resounding consensus on the importance of   broadband access to the daily lives of Canadians. Canadians have spoken and CNOC agrees that   broadband access must therefore be considered a basic telecommunications service. Although the   status of broadband as a basic service is now evident, the approach to defining the basic service   objective is still somewhat unclear. In its first intervention, CNOC proposed a method of tiering different types of broadband   applications or uses based on minimum supporting technical requirements. As the proceeding   evolved, the focus has now shifted to distinguishing between the ‘needs’ and ‘wants’ of Canadians. In the context of a proceeding aimed at empowering Canadians with access to the digital economy,   CNOC concedes that a needs vs. wants approach is more appropriate and streamlined than a multi-  tiered classification model based on minimum supporting technical requirements.

If the Commission determines that an   expanded contribution mechanism is necessary, such a mechanism must be complementary to   government sourced funding and appropriately calibrated to minimize the risks discussed above.   CNOC intervention dated  July , at para .   For example, the affordability funding mechanism and broadband deployment funding mechanisms proposed by   AAC in its intervention dated  July .   Wall Report, at p..   CNOC provided examples of consumer sensitivity to very minor increases to monthly bills in Transcript Volume   , at paras -.    . Affordability of Broadband Services    . Based on Canada’s international rankings when it comes to price for broadband services,   it is no surprise that affordability has become an important issue in this proceeding. Parties like   the Affordable Access Coalition (“AAC”) have suggested that it is incumbent on the Commission   to resolve affordability issues through NCF funded affordability funding mechanisms. These   proposals must be rejected for two main reasons. First, subsidy programs for broader affordability   issues are properly within the constitutional jurisdiction of provincial and territorial   governments. Beyond jurisdictional qualifications, provincial government are also the experts in   leading social assistance programs and the Commission is not. Furthermore, the introduction or   expansion of a subsidy for monthly telecommunications costs must be contemplated alongside all   other social assistance programs within a province or territory’s control that may be indirectly   affected. Second, like broadband deployment programs funded through the NCF, AAC’s proposed   affordability funding mechanism runs the risk of creating substantial deadweight losses that would   ripple throughout the economy.

Mr. John Macri  Director, Policy Framework  Telecommunications Sector,  CRTC  Ottawa, ON   KA N    Dear Mr. Macri    Ref: Telecom Consultation CRTC - (as amended) “Review of Basic  Telecommunications Services” File number: -C-  Filed by GC Key    In response to your letter of April , Cree Nation Government and the Eeyou  Communications Network submit the attached information. Sincerely       (original signed)      Alfred Loon  Cree Nation Government  Eeyou Communications Network      Reply to CRTC Letter -- ): Reference: -C-    Cree Nation Government / Eeyou Communications Network   ________________________________________________________________________   _______________________________________________________________________ May ,   Page  of           Response to Question :    . In our view, we believe that the CRTC is authorized to mandate the provision of   Internet services and to establish and to change the requirements for minimum  speeds. The Objectives in the Telecommunications Act of Canada clearly state  that the intention of the legislation is to provide ( b) “telecommunications  services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas”. As this service is already provided by a Canadian carrier, it falls within  b) –  fair treatment -- and  of the Telecommunications Act, “The offering and  provision of any telecommunications service by a Canadian carrier are subject to  any conditions imposed by the Commission…”     . Further, in CRTC -, the Commission policy establishes Internet speeds   within its Basic Service Objective. In that decision which is undisputed by  Canadian carriers, the Commission stated: “The basic service objective consists  of… access to low-speed Internet at local rates… As the technology has evolved  since that time, it is appropriate under Section  b) to reset the requirement. Regarding underserved areas where the Internet service is provided to some but   not all residents, there should be a clear and simple evaluation process for  underserved areas where a licensed carrier operates. . If Internet service is not available due to a physical and technological     incapability, the CRTC should require that the provider present a service     improvement plan with a clear short-term schedule for implementation. . If the service provider is physically and technologically capable of     delivery but will not or refuses to provide Internet service, the CRTC     should exercise its authority to insure that the service is provided. Regarding unserved areas, we endorse the Affordable Access Coalition     proposal for build-out subsidies so that Internet services can be delivered by   parties  licensed by the CRTC to provide and meet the Basic Services Objectives.

I live in Nunavut. We do not have access to world class telecommunications service. Prior to living here, I have lived in  countries around the world over the past  years. Telecommunications is always something quite central to my experience. Northern Canada suffers from a very low level of connectivity for this day in age relative to places in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. There is no question Northern Canadians will suffer developmental consequences if the connectivity of these regions, already struggling to catch up to the rest of the country, remains as it is. Our connectivity is far from world class in the North. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER a9bd26daec5c9280138eb75075236390b2cf21a6def1e947a2c42ff678764934
If the picture does go, it will take several minutes to load. Internet access from my handset is equally un-world-class. I rarely get speeds that represent the G service I subscribe to - typical applications that work on other handsets such as Facebook don't work well here. The pictures simply don't load in any reasonable time. I also pay $/month for home ("high speed"?) internet through the Qinik service. It, too, is far from world class. I am not able to watch youtube videos or Skype with my family. Using online services that have high security like online banking often timeout before my transaction is complete. Sometimes my email takes more time than it should to download. Measuring internet speeds is something that can be done objectively and empirically.

Less stress because my finances less strained. The world would  make more sense because there would be a more ra- onal link between the value of the service and what I pay for it. As it is, I feel that I pay for a premium service when all I need is a basic package. The carrier provides me with way more  "bandwidth" or capacity than I need and than I ever use. But there is no cheaper, less fancy product. I just want basic,  basic Internet service. Instead, I have fancy service and pay a crazy high price.

Everything is now on-line, books, informa on, job applica ons, news, and purchasing or reserving goods and services;  therefore, if you can't afford $. per month (and the poorest of us can not) for basic light internet, you can not par-  cipate fully in society.

By the end of this year (), Xplornet will offer a service with speeds of  Mbps down  and  Mbps up in all regions of Canada and by  all Canadians will have access to its   Mbps down and  Mbps up service. There is no need for regulation in this market. As noted above, since the last hearing in , speeds and data allowances have increased  and prices on a per Mbps basis have decreased without regulation. Demands of customers  in the competitive market have been the sole driver of these changes. As a result, there  does not appear to be a rationale for creating a service obligation or regulations for the  provision of Internet access services. c.  What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these  prices be determined? The competitive market should determine the price for high-speed Internet services. Market forces are strong enough to ensure that customers are not overcharged. The only  exception should be for services that are provided pursuant to a subsidy program like the  Connecting Canadians program. In such cases, it is fair to contractually tie a maximum  chargeable price to a competitive bid for subsidies. There are a wide variety of technologies being used to deliver Internet access services and  it is unrealistic for the Commission to assess the cost of each technology and become an     -  -   expert for the purposes of determining prices.

Internet Access Speed Requirements for Commonly Accessed Online Services. [image: ]  As indicated by Figure  many of the commonly accessed online services require less than a  Mbps connection. As noted in paragraph , HD content is an increasingly important aspect of internet use, and speed targets must be adjusted for these needs. Furthermore, there are a number of uses that require even greater speed ranges. David Salway suggests a range of  to  Mbps to operate video surveillance,  to  Mbps for Video Conferencing (Multiple users), Remote Supercomputing and over  Mbps for Real-Time Data Collection, and Real-Time Medical Image Consultation.

Upload speed is an equally important consideration for a range of uses from file sharing and cloud computing to interactive learning. According to the FCC, “ideally, all of these applications would work best if upload speed were as high as download speed.”[footnoteRef:]  In considering minimum upload speeds, the CRTC should consider the benefits of requiring symmetrical upload and download speeds.

As noted in paragraph , FTTP is the increasing benchmark for internet connectivity and for wired connections it should be considered the most important underlying technology.

Actual versus advertised speeds is a key characteristic that should be considered. Consumers have often experienced differences between advertised broadband speeds and actual speeds. This situation is usually detrimental for the consumers who were promised and pay for a higher broadband speed than that received. This is not an invisible problem; the key players in the industry are aware of this challenge, as such “discussions of broadband performance have paid increasing attention to the sometimes significant gaps between advertised speeds and the ‘actual’ speeds consumers may experience.”[footnoteRef:] Policy makers throughout the OECD have become increasing attuned to the importance of the monitoring actual versus advertised speeds. [footnoteRef:]  In order to ensure actual speed targets are being met, service providers should have to regularly report speed performance as well as participate in third party testing. What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these prices be determined? As reflected in section (b) of the Telecommunications Act/Canadian Telecommunication Policy, affordability is a required objective of Canada’s telecommunications system. As indicated in paragraph , there are considerable differences in the cost of broadband internet in various regions of the country both in absolute terms and relative to pre-tax income. At the same time, we recognize the capital and operating costs of building telecommunications infrastructure both for wired and wireless connections and ensuring necessary capacity. As indicated in the most recent Price Comparisons of Wireline , Wireless and internet Services in Canada with Foreign Jurisdictions Report (Wall Report) Canadian wireline and wireless services, particularly in the lowest three costs baskets, have increased in cost significantly the past year,[footnoteRef:] though broadband prices have declined relative to last year. [footnoteRef:]  “Canadian broadband Internet service prices compare favourably with the other surveyed countries in the case of the Level  (< . Mbps download speeds) and Level  ( –  Mbps) broadband service baskets.”[footnoteRef:] However, the Canadian Level  and Level  service baskets did not compare as favourably, as these “basket prices are higher than the prices measured in the surveyed countries included in the study, with the exception of Japan and the U.S. in the first case and solely the U.S. in the latter case.”[footnoteRef:] [:   Wall Communications.

As noted by the  Communication Monitoring Report, Canadian broadband pricing for fixed broadband at the very high speed (> Mbps) is ranked second highest (behind only the United States) out of the list of seven comparator countries. [footnoteRef:]  Canada also ranks second highest in the comparator group with respect to cost for average mobile services. [footnoteRef:]   [:  CRTC. Communications Monitoring Report . p. . ] While international comparisons are useful for identifying the general cost of Canadian broadband services relative to other countries, it is also necessary to consider what a reasonable price for broadband would be relative to other expenditures and income. For example, Statistics Canada reports that the average expenditure on household utilities (water, electricity and fuel) in  represents % of all household expenditures. [footnoteRef:]  By comparison household expenditures on all communications services amounted to roughly .% of total household spending. [footnoteRef:]  Given existing spending on communications and utilities expenditures, having broadband offered at as basic service, it would appear reasonable to have a price of roughly % of total household expenditures.

Canadians are using telecommunications services to fulfill many social, economic, and cultural needs in today’s   digital economy. For example, uses may include e-  commerce (i.e. the online purchase and trade of products or services), e-banking and/or telephone banking,   e-health or telehealth services, telework, and distance education. Which of these uses of telecommunications   services are the most important to ensure that Canadians meaningfully participate in the digital economy?

In today’s   digital economy, virtually all telecommunications services are provided using the Internet Protocol (IP) over   the Internet. For this reason, it is not appropriate to rank the previously distinguishable services in terms of   importance. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 778ad82eb3a4862222fc0964d7b6d2bb910b56243190fca8487a136fde493dc1
With respect to the first target, assuming that the Basic Service is defined as a service that should be both   economically and physically available for everyone, then the current target speeds of Mbps/Mbps are likely   adequate. However, the Commission should include both Latency and Volume targets in the Basic Service as   well. The Latency targets define usability and the Volume targets define the total quantity available. As   discussed in the response to .b below, the Basic Service specification should include target Latency   characteristics of ms and Volume offerings of at least  GB/Month. With respect to the second target for Broadband Service, this should include at least  Mbps download speed,    Mbps upload, latencies of ms and at least  GB/Month of data. This should be available to % of   Canadians by . Such Basic and Broadband target speeds should be reconsidered on a regular basis. The Commission’s role regarding access to basic telecommunications services       . Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic telecommunications services necessary for   Canadians to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital economy? Our Response      As provided in our response above, the Internet is the all-encompassing service required for Canadians to   meaningfully participate in the digital economy. Low Latency Internet Access has become the primary and most important service for basic telecommunications. Because low latency access allows every other form of telecommunications to be made available,   including:       Voice Calls    Mobile Network Extension (SmallCells)    Fax    Internet and data services for television, streaming, emailing, static web-browsing and e-commerce, as well  as other professional, business and operational communications necessary to conduct business, scientific   research and government activities      a. cable, digital subscriber line, fiber, fixed wireless, mobile   wireless, and satellite technology) should be a factor in defining whether a telecommunications service   should be considered a basic service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  www.oneweb.net      Our Response      The underlying technology should not be considered a factor in defining whether a telecommunications   service should be considered a Basic Service.

Technology is only a means to provide Basic Services. Therefore, the definition of a Basic Service should be defined by the link quality parameters of .b., above,   rather than any particular technology. These are basic physical parameters defined generally for all digital   communication systems and are independent of any specific physical hardware and software implementation   of a digital telecommunication network.

 TSPs would then submit bids to provide a basket of services to end users based on the area and subsidy   provided by the varying levels of government. The TSP with the best basket of services and best upgrade   path would be awarded the contract guarantee. After the infrastructure is completed, the TSP would then   have to sell the product. Each customer would reduce the government commitments and represent an   upsell opportunity to the TSP to provide the recommended minimum Broadband Service.  The Service Provider would then have a known minimum quantity customer set and could be reliably   incentivized to build infrastructure in regions, which otherwise would represent too high of a risk. What should be the Commission’s role in ensuring the availability of basic telecommunications services to all   Canadians? What action, if any, should the Commission take where Canadians do not have access to   telecommunications services that are considered to be basic services?

Supporting infrastructure through direct government funding is the surest way to achieve such coverage and   a basket of technologies will be most appropriate. The funding criteria should weigh in favor of technologies that will support Broadband Services for unserved   and underserved Canadians in all regions of the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  www.oneweb.net      b. What impact would the establishment of such a mechanism have on private sector investment and   government programs to fund the provision of modern telecommunications services? What other services, if any,   should be defined as basic telecommunications services? Our Response      Basic Services as defined above should be included in the definition of basic telecommunications services. The   provision of dial tone voice will be less expensive when bundled with a basic Internet offering than providing voice   services alone. What resulting changes, if any,   would be required to the existing regulatory frameworks (e.g. Your response should address, with   supporting rationale, which TSPs should be required to contribute to the NCF, which revenues should be   contribution-eligible and which revenues, if any, should be excluded from the calculation of contribution-eligible   revenues. Explain, with   supporting details, which services should be subsidized and under what circumstances. Our Response      The definition of Basic Services should be updated and revisited from time to time in order to ensure that it properly   reflects the needs of Canadian citizens and consumers.

A   scenario where Mornington Communications faces the loss of high-cost subsidy     CITC-JTF   Page      across its entire exchange simply because it seeks flexibility to vigorously   compete against a CLEC in its core area is not appropriate. The JTF is proposing that this one key component of the SILEC forbearance   regime be revised by the Commission in this proceeding. If the Commission   grants forbearance, the order should cover only those areas that are actually   served by the competitor, leaving the remaining areas where there are no   competitive alternatives regulated and where the incumbent service provider   would continue to receive funding from the CFA. This proceeding represents the opportunity for the Commission to correct   these problem areas of the existing contribution regime and ensure that there   are no unfunded obligations. If federal authorities impose obligations such as the   OTS and the BSO, they must be fully funded. Issues with the current Basic Service Objective   . The existing Basic Service Objective (“BSO”) was established by the   Commission in Telephone Service to High-Cost Serving Areas - Telecom Decision   CRTC -,  October  and set out the minimum list of services that   Canadians are entitled to. The basic service objective consists of the following:   • individual line local Touch-Tone service;     CITC-JTF   Page      • access to low-speed Internet at local rates; access to the long   distance network and to operator/directory assistance services;   • enhanced calling features, including access to emergency   services, voice message relay service, and privacy protection   features; and   • a copy of the current local telephone directory   . Implicit in the BSO is the provision of a paper bill included as part of the   price of residential Primary Exchange Service (“PES”). The JTF is making   recommendations with regards to both the provision of a paper directory and a   paper bill in its responses to the Commission’s questions. In short, paper bills and   local telephone directories should only be required to be provided upon request. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER fc6685e55724efd1306cf05c25ddd39d8a00b02be586f37009e8a2e18568eeeb
[] Capital  expenditures on Canadian communications infrastructure have also been substantial  compared to other developed countries because Canadian communications policy  has been quite conducive to carrier investment. Facilities-based competition has  spurred sustained waves of high level investment. OECD data on communications  sector capital spending per access path show that Canadian carriers have spent more  than their US counterparts and about twice as much as EU carriers per access path  since . This sustained level of investment, coupled with targeted subsidies by the federal government, underline  the Commission’s success when it takes a light regulatory touch to the sector and defers to competitive  market forces. This fact should not be lost as the Commission reflects on the questions raised in its public  notice. / Mbps Should Be The Basic Service Objective   . CRTC Exhibit  provides a useful presentation of the bandwidths required to deliver a variety of popular  Internet services. It demonstrates that most Internet applications are deliverable at speeds of  Mbps or  less. The main services that are not deliverable at that speed are some real-time video games and the  streaming of higher definition video content. Xplornet was joined by numerous other parties to this hearing  in characterizing these other services as “wants” not “needs”.

 Bell et al(Telus)Aug- TNC -  Attachment    Page  of      The_Companies(CRTC)Dec- TNs  &   Attachment    Page  of      The Appropriate Pricing Standard for Wholesale Loops      Joseph Gillan, Gillan Associates   George Hariton, Telecommunications Issues and Analysis     The United States and Canada have adopted similar forward-looking pricing standards to  establish wholesale lease rates for local loops provided by incumbents to entrants, where such  wholesale facilities have been found by a regulator to be critical to local competition.  Recently,  as the demand for traditional switched local phone service has fallen, questions have arisen as  to whether a forward-looking pricing standard remains appropriate. The purpose of this paper is  to explain that forward-looking costing principles provide the appropriate wholesale pricing  signal even during a period where switched demand may be declining. Basic Principles    . The key to establishing appropriate pricing is recognizing that the central economic   purpose of a price is to provide the correct incentives for resource allocation. That is,  the purpose of a price is to direct resources to those uses where they provide the  greatest value. To be successful in this simple but powerful role requires that prices  generally comply with the following propositions:     * Prices should reflect economic costs – that is, the price should reflect the value   of the resources consumed in the creation of a good or service. In this way,  providers and consumers can best judge whether to devote their resources to the  production or consumption of a product (good or service) by comparing the value  of the resources they must surrender to the value (i.e., the price) of the  good/service being acquired. * Costs should be measured on a forward-looking basis, which means that the only   costs that are relevant are the costs that will be incurred as a consequence of a  decision.

For many of the individuals living in MKO  First Nations, one of the conseqeunces of being in a high-cost serving area is that  available POTS are often busy and calls cannot be made outside of the community or  come through. Rather than be cut-off entirely from communicating both inside and  outside the community, individuals turn to the Internet to fill the substantial gap in  adequate telecommunications services. And yet, despite its essential nature, Internet service for most MKO First  Nations is substandard. Access to the Internet is significantly hindered by slow speeds  and much higher volume of traffic per connection as compared to residences in and  around urban centres. The objectives of the Telecommunication Act will not be met unless due regard  is paid to the unique barriers faced by remote and northern First Nations. The Inclusion of Broadband in Basic Services  . The CRTC has recognized that its primary regulatory goal is for all Canadians,  regardless of where they reside, to have reasonable access to basic telecommunication  services. Section  of the Telecommunications Act affirms that one of the objectives of  Canadian telecommunications policy is to render “reliable and affordable  telecommunications services of high quality accessible to Canadians both in urban and  rural areas in all regions of Canada.” The importance of providing essential public  services of a reasonable quality to all Canadians is also a recognized constitutional  principle.   . Broadband Internet services have become an essential telecommunications  services. That reality should be recognized by the CRTC.

A contract would not be awarded where the bid is above the cap. This  subsidy cap would have to be established by the administrator of the BDFM through a  cost analysis. The cap could be based on the estimated cost versus the regulated rate and  established through an equivalent of the remoteness factor under the current subsidy  regime to ensure uniformity. If the cap were set too low and no bids were submitted, the cap may have to be  re-assessed and a new round of bids may have to be undertaken. The cap should be  communicated to any potential service providers so that it can be taken into account in  the preparation of any proposals, increasing the efficiency of the process. Infrastructure and Internet Service Providers  . It is important to note that in remote areas, there is often limited infrastructure in place to provide broadband to the MKO First Nations. In some cases, it is possible that  the provider of the core infrastructure necessary for broadband services will be different  than the Internet Service Provider to the community and to individual consumers. For example, under the BCN Community Internet Service Provider (ISP) model, BCN manages the provincial network, which brings service to the local community  tower. The community then purchases wholesale bandwidth from BCN and resells the  service to the local community. The community ISP acts as a point of contact for local  customers by selling and installing subscriber units and Internet packages.   .

Having reviewed the reports of the National Broadband Task Force and Telecom Policy Review Panel, a National Broadband Strategy should be framed by key principles and we list these in Appendix  to our remarks. And because a strategy needs leadership to get results, we propose a multi-stakeholder advisory council to oversee the strategy’s implementation. The council would bring together the many levels of government, industry, consumers and non-governmental organizations. The record of this proceeding has much to contribute on how to fulfill our proposed principles. We will expand on these aspects as we turn to our specific proposals in this proceeding. () Defining Broadband Internet as a Basic Service . Rogers agrees that the definition of basic telecom service should include broadband Internet. Rogers recommends that the definition of basic telecom service should include a broadband Internet service that provides a connection of no less than  Megabits per second download and  Megabit per second upload. A broadband connection of  and  is sufficient to support the basic telecommunications requirements of Canadians. The most popular types of online activities, encompassing everything from emailing to watching high-def video, can be enjoyed using a basic  and  connection. Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, requires only a fraction of this bandwidth. This is illustrated by CRTC Exhibit . The same bandwidth requirements are true for VRS which performs well at less than  megabit. Broadband Internet service will continue to evolve, and in keeping with that evolution, the Commission should establish a more advanced level of service as a prospective target.

The questions of what is economic must be determined by discussions of national priorities, as discussed above starting at paragraph . Regulatory measures for basic telecommunications services  Question  . Question  asks “Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? What other services, if any, should be defined as basic telecommunications services?” It has been noted above (paragraph ) that the model for delivering telecommunications services is shifting to transmission of data over broadband networks. In this context, all telecommunication services become applications on broadband networks. From this perspective, the only type of service that should be defined as a basic telecommunications service is a high quality broadband network. With appropriate measures in place to ensure all providers have access to deliver services over networks, all telecommunications services that were delivered on a mix of technologies in the past (voice using copper phone lines, television using coaxial cable) can be delivered over a broadband network. As this consultation plays out over time, there is an opportunity to explore the implications of retiring old network infrastructure (copper, coaxial cable) and shifting these services onto broadband networks.

Based on the evidence presented in this consultation, OpenMedia submits that it is time for the   Commission to require the large operators to contribute to a sustainable cross-subsidy   mechanism designed to address the serious concerns about infrastructure investments and   affordability considerations with respect to vulnerable populations. In order to maximize the   impact of available public and private funds, such a mechanism will need to have certain   safeguards built in. For example, any funds intended to address network infrastructure or   affordability should be allocated using competitive tendering procedures only, and they should be   applied strictly to next generation fibre transport and access facilities (as well as G+ mobile and   community wireless initiatives). Furthermore, the right to bid on any public subsidy scheme   should be conditional on bidders agreeing explicitly to open-access obligations, as well as to   verifiable targets for actual, not advertised, connectivity speeds. In order to achieve the basic service objectives of the Telecommunications Act, OpenMedia   submits that it would be in the interests of all Canadians, including incumbent operators, for the   Commission to enact the following recommendations. The Commission should:       . Recognize that broadband access is presumptively viewed as an essential service by most  Canadians and thereby include broadband Internet access services, both fixed and mobile, in the  basic service framework. Build on the Commission’s approach to “skinny basic” TV service to address affordability  concerns by mandating that all service providers offer at least one subscription plan that includes  a verifiable minimum service quality guarantee at all times of day for all applications, and is  reasonably priced. Recognize that a more robust basic service framework that includes minimum service quality   guarantees is entirely compatible with aspirational speed targets on par with our international  counterparts. Ensure that indicators of performance are drawn from actual performance measurements, rather  than advertised best effort speeds, in line with the Commission’s - decision. Phase out data caps.

TELUS applies these principles in addressing   the issues raised in the Notice in the remainder of this first Intervention.

Basic Telecommunications Services:  Definition and Proposed Services   . This section develops TELUS’ views on what is the fundamental issue in this proceeding   – what basic telecommunications services do Canadians require to participate   meaningfully in the digital economy? Because there is no statutory definition of what   constitutes a BTS, TELUS applies the public policy principles it has developed for this   proceeding to assist the Commission in its deliberations on this important issue. . No Definition of Basic Telecommunications Services in the   Telecommunications Act    . It is critical at the outset of this discussion to define what is meant precisely by a BTS. Notably, the Telecommunications Act does not define a basic telecommunications service   despite the fact that the concept itself is referenced throughout the statute.     Nor can a   definition of BTS be found in past Commission proceedings. For example, in Telecom   Regulatory Policy (“TRP”) -, Obligation to serve and other matters, the   Commission did not state what goals were to be achieved, nor what objectives were to be   met in creating basic services beyond identifying particular services. At paragraph  of   TRP -, the Commission addresses the various types of telephony features and   services that are included in the basic service objective (“BSO”), but does not provide a   rationale for why they were included.

The TELUS public policy principles are found in Section .     For references to “basic telecommunications services” see, for example, Telecommunications Act, ss    “telecommunications service provider,”  and . (). TELUS Communications Company TNC -   July ,  First Intervention            . The first TELUS public policy principle defines a basic telecommunications service in   terms of a telecommunications service that is necessary or indispensable for meaningful   participation in the digital economy. A BTS is a service   recognized to be of such critical importance to the economic and social welfare of   Canadian citizens that universal access to such services at affordable rates is necessary   for “meaningful participation in the digital economy.”      .. Principle . Basic Telecommunications Service (BTS) Definition   . A number of important observations follow directly from TELUS public policy principle    and each of them is discussed in turn. First, it is important to recognize that the definition of a basic telecommunications service   is likely to vary from one observer to another and defies absolute precision due to the   normative nature of the question.     Based on the classic construct of Maslow’s Hierarchy   of Needs,    we can all agree that human survival requires food, shelter and clothing. And   yet, reaching agreement on the specific types and quantities of food, shelter and clothing   that are required is considerably more difficult, if it is possible at all. In a similar vein, we   can all agree that Canadians require telecommunications services in order to   communicate and function in a modern society.

http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=   TELUS Communications Company TNC -   July ,  First Intervention            whereas for more advanced telecommunications services (e.g., Internet broadband)   universal access may well be the goal.         .. The specific technological platform for supplying a BTS is immaterial   . Once the set of basic telecommunications services has been well defined, the   Commission should remain agnostic with respect to the particular technological platform   (wireline, wireless or satellite) that is used to deliver these BTS to consumers. If the   Commission were to do otherwise, it would violate the principle of minimally intrusive   regulation called for in Section  (a)(ii) of the Policy Direction to the CRTC. This   section of the Policy Direction states that Commission should “when relying upon   regulation, use measures that are efficient and proportionate to their purpose and that   interfere with the operation of competitive market forces to the minimum extent   necessary to meet the policy objectives.”  The concept of technological neutrality is   stated in TELUS public policy principle .      . Basic Services:  Voice Telephony   . In TELUS’ view, the process used to define basic telephony services represents an   opportunity for the Commission to establish service and feature/functionality floors for   consumers. A key theme that TELUS recognizes in its policy prescription is that   technological change in combination with the ever-increasing intensity of market forces   demands a dynamic BTS classification; services will necessarily be added to the list and   subtracted from the list of basic telecommunication services over time. This should not                                                         The literature differentiates between universal access (UA) and universal service (US).

Basic Internet Services:  Broadband Internet   . In , the Commission adopted an aspirational target speed for broadband services of    Mbps downstream and  Mbps upstream for Internet service (“/ Mbps”), but did not   include broadband as part of the BSO. One of the central questions posed by the   Commission in this proceeding concerns whether broadband should be considered a basic   telecommunications service. In TELUS’ view, broadband is undeniably a BTS in today’s   digital economy.

Canada has strong platform competition   . Dr. Crandall concludes that “the widespread availability of high-speed broadband in   Canada is the result of strong platform competition among incumbent   telecommunications carriers, cable television companies, and wireless carriers and   extremely high rates of capital spending on these platforms.”     Dr. Crandall states,   With strong capital investment from telecom companies and cable   companies, high-speed access is available even in rural areas in Canada. Much of the reason for this success lies in the Commission’s reliance on   platform competition between cable television companies and traditional   ILECs.        .. High broadband speeds are available in Canada   . Because of this strong platform competition, Dr. Crandall notes that “(b)roadband speeds   of  Mbps or more are available to more than  percent of Canadian households, but   most households choose to subscribe to lower-speed services, presumably because they   do not require higher speeds for the current generation of applications.”      .

However, if the   Commission determines that there is a need for a subsidy, using a bidding mechanism,   similar to the one already used by Industry Canada for the Connecting Canadians   program, or a reverse auction, would minimize the size of the required subsidy. Furthermore, any subsidy should be funded out of general tax revenues, and, failing that,   from a broad-based telecommunications charge. TELUS Communications Company TNC -   July ,  First Intervention            . Summary of TELUS Recommendations    . The most significant action that the Commission can take is to maintain a robust   commitment to facilities-based competition policies by limiting unbundling of networks. This will increase network availability and broadband adoption. Basic Telecommunications Services   . TELUS recommends that a BTS be defined as follows:     A BTS is a service recognized to be of such critical importance to the   economic and social welfare of Canadian citizens that universal access to   such services at affordable rates is necessary for meaningful participation   in the digital economy. Based on this definition, the Commission should classify the following services as BTS:    Access to an individual local line with Touch-Tone service;    Access to the long distance network;    Access to operator services;    Access to a directory service;    Access to emergency services;    Access to privacy protection services;     Accessibility-related services for persons with disabilities; and    Access to broadband service at the / Mbps target speed. The Commission should no longer classify the following services as BTS:     Access to low-speed Internet at local rates (dial-up);    Choice of long distance Network (i.e., equal access); and    Requirement of an ILEC to make a copy of a local telephone directory available   upon request.

APPENDIX B: REGRESSION ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK  FOR MEASURING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF  BROADBAND SPEED  Regression analysis is a statistical method for identifying  the relationship between two or more variables. In applied  economic research it is a tool that allows us to investigate,  for example, economic output as a function of multiple  parameters shaping the society using real-world data. Consequently, it is a relevant method in virtually every branch  of applied economics, used by researchers worldwide. The concept of regression analysis  In order to carry out a regression analysis, a large set of  observed data points is required – not only the study-specific  variables, but also control variables. The control variables  correlate with the dependent variables, apart from a variable  of investigation, e.g. broadband speed. By adding control  variables to the regression analysis, one can, for example,  better isolate the effect of broadband speed on household  income, and avoid omitted variable problems. With larger  coverage of the variables influencing the dependent variable,  a more accurate analysis is possible. In addition, a noise  term is added to the function, which reflects other unknown  factors that affect the output, including randomness. Figure  shows how regression analysis assumes that the  noise term is zero on average. GDP = α + β  x    + β   x    + … + β  i x    + ε  GDP = f (control variables, broadband speed)  Initial hypothesis  Hypothesis specifically formulated  with all independent variables that  are assumed to impact GDP  The aim of regression analysis is to produce estimates of the constant and the coefficients (α, β   , β   , β   , …), which are unobservable in real life  Observed data  α = a constant amount; describes GDP when there is no  change in broadband penetration  and broadband speed, i.e. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 323fe12f7bac879e49cad09520cb2e507c520ef5e8399ebf4e09704c56b59b01
Consider two random  variables with the same mean (same average). If one of them has a distribution with greater variance, then,  roughly speaking, the probability that the variable will take on a value far from the mean is greater.

For this purpose, the government has issued  new spectrum licences to four companies that will roll-out new wireless broadband services based on  WiMAX platforms. Furthermore, to rationalize capital investment, the government has imposed sharing requirements for  towers among high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) and WiMAX operators. Finally, as an incentive  for operators to roll-out their broadband networks, the government also approved tax allowances on  expenditures on last-mile broadband equipment. In general terms, most developing countries' policy makers now envision mobile broadband as a key lever  to address the digital inclusion gap.

The Township formed a  Committee-of-Council staffed by Municipal, PUC and local business members and  empowered it to act. Key start-up issues and questions to be answered included:      • If the decline keeps up, what then? • Can we do a broadband project? • If so, is it a good idea? • Who can do build and operate the system? • Who will own it? • How can the expense be justified to ratepayers? A revisit of the Township’s strategic plan was needed. In the past, communications and  knowledge-based issues were not addressed in the Township’s Strategic Planning, even  though, when asked, most felt it was an extremely important factor in the development  and economics of the community.

Mr. Sepulveda fails to provide any estimate of the benefits and the full cost of these two   proposed programs. (b) Subsidies for voice   . [ROBERT CRANDALL] Before we leave the issue of subsidies, I would like to   mention Bell’s proposal to end the subsidy regime in Rate Bands E and F. This proposal   is unprincipled, based on faulty analysis and may jeopardize telephone service to   Canadians in high cost serving areas. The proposal is based on the same reports of   alleged bias in the Phase II costing methodology that they presented to the Commission   in . I have fully explained this in my evidence in this proceeding. Universal Service    . [RICHARD SCHULTZ] Some of the submissions before you premise their proposals   for extensive and expensive subsidy programmes on the claim that Canadian   telecommunications policy has had a longstanding public policy of universal service. While Canada did develop what is considered to be   universal telephone service, this was done not through regulatory intervention but as a   result of corporate practice. It arose simply and solely as a result of federally regulated     TELUS Communications Company   TNC -   Oral Presentation   Check Against Delivery         telephone companies employing pricing to make telephone service available as widely   as possible. If these parties want to justify their proposals, instead of relying on a false restatement   of the history of universal service, they instead need to look at what they will do, how   they will implement it, and what it will cost. And they need to demonstrate that the   economic and social benefits exceed the economic costs. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 8a403817f2a420a641dd9cd8f72517ee784ddf7a6576e3e228cc3c3d18bd2bd8
ISED clearly indicated that this program funding will be devoted  to transport facilities as opposed to last mile infrastructure. Therefore, the  Commission should be under no illusion that the recent federal budget money will be  available to contribute directly to the expansion of last mile broadband infrastructure. In the absence of any action by the Commission in this proceeding regarding last mile                                                             See for example paragraph vi. of Quebecor’s executive summary. Page      broadband connectivity, there will be no federal initiatives to address the urgent need  for broadband enabled last mile connections. Broadband subsidy  . At paragraph  of its final written submission OpenMedia states:     No national broadband strategy should fund or encourage the  continued use of legacy platforms, especially xDSL. The JTF submits that OpenMedia’s position is short-sighted and ignores the fact  that copper and coaxial networks can indeed be upgraded to provide rural Canadians  with next level of broadband Internet connections (e.g. / Mbps services). Indeed,  it is interesting to note that a new copper-based technology known as G.Fast with the  possibility of providing  Mbps download is already being deployed. In a world of  limited financial resources and existing, usable network infrastructure already in place,  it would make no sense to focus exclusively on fibre optic last mile infrastructure. As noted by the JTF at the oral hearing, its member companies continue to  exploit last mile copper infrastructure in rural areas by installing fibre fed remotes (i.e. electronic nodes) closer and closer to end customers thereby shortening copper loop  lengths and enabling faster Internet connections. As advocated by the JTF in this  proceeding, any Broadband Basic Service Objective (“BSO”) should be technology  neutral.

Rogers is also filing expert evidence prepared by Dr. Scott Wallsten, “Principles  and Practices of Universal Service – Lessons from the United States,” included  as Appendix . Dr. Wallsten’s report reviews universal service policies and  programs in the United States that sought to improve the availability and  affordability of voice and Internet services, discusses their shortcomings and  lessons for Canada.

The results of the survey, which  was conducted in October , include findings on the proportion of Canadians  that do not access the Internet at home and key reasons for not subscribing. . Basic telecommunications service   . Defining Basic Telecom Service   . Rogers remains of the view that broadband Internet service is a basic telecom  service that should be available to all Canadians. It provides a primary means for  participation in the digital economy and society by providing users with a vast  array of services and applications. It enables Canadians to communicate using  tools such as voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), e-mail, and social networking. These forms of communication are both complements to, and substitutes for,  traditional “Plain Old Telephone Service” (POTS) that is the cornerstone of the  existing definition of basic telecommunications service.

Rogers Intervention  ABRIDGED   TNC -  Page  of          . Some parties have cited higher service levels that are being pursued in other  countries. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a report that  stated that  Mbps download and  Mbps upload represents “advanced  telecommunications capability”. The FCC also oversees the Connect America  program that provides funding support for broadband Internet at speeds of /  Mbps for households that lack access to service at speeds of at least / Mbps.  The FCC has different statutory requirements under the Telecommunications Act  of  and, as a result, the / Mbps benchmark indicates whether  households have access to advanced services whereas the / Mbps standard  focuses on access to basic services. And to be clear, funding to provide speeds  of / Mbps is only available where communities do not have access to at least  / Mbps service. If a community has broadband service with speeds of /, no  funding is available. Dr. Wallsten’s report further discusses the evolution of the  FCC’s definition of broadband to the / Mbps benchmark; a benchmark that he  finds is “not especially informative” of consumer preferences.    . The Affordable Access Coalition (AAC) proposed a standard of  Mbps  download and  Mbps upload. Setting the standard at this level would require  upgrading service extensively in order to ensure all Canadians had access to this  speed at a minimum. AAC proposed a subsidy program to fund upgrading  networks to deliver this level level of service. AAC also proposed prioritizing  funding to communities that did not already have access to / Mbps. Some  communities with access to / Mbps would not be upgraded, depending on the  funding available. Under AAC’s proposed definition of basic telecom services,  these communities would not achieve the standard for broadband Internet. This  puts into question the practicality of establishing the standard at / Mbps. Rogers agrees that, to the extent the Commission adopts a new subsidy program  to support deployment of broadband Internet networks, priority should be given to  areas that do not have access to / Mbps, and will not have access after the  Connecting Canadians program is completed. Rogers also supports proposals  that any new broadband subsidy program should support building to a higher  standard rather than subsidize the construction of legacy technology.

Connecting  Canadians includes such requirements, and similar provisions have been  included in certain provincial initiatives. In the United States, the funding  provided under the Connect America program attaches similar conditions. An obligation to serve in markets where a subsidy is available would align with  the current regime and take into account the limited potential of competitive  pressures in such areas. In areas where competitive alternatives are available,  market forces are sufficient to achieve the objectives without an obligation to  serve or subsidy support. . Availability of Broadband Internet   . The availability of broadband Internet across Canada’s vast territory is a success  story by any measure. Monitoring by the Commission indicated that / Mbps  service is available to  percent of Canadian households over multiple  platforms, including LTE and satellite, based on information at the end of .  The federal government program, Connecting Canadians, will extend coverage  over the next two years to encompass more than  percent of households.    . Xplornet already offers  / Mbps service tiers and announced that / Mbps will be available in the next  year. OneWeb stated that it plans to offer service as of  using a  constellation of low-earth orbiting satellites capable of delivering speeds of up to  / Mbps, with low latency comparable to fibre and cable modem services.  Satellite-based initiatives will provide coverage to remote areas of Canada,  including the northern territories. Rogers is continuing to invest in its wireline and wireless network to bring the  most advanced technologies to consumers. Within Rogers’ territory, more than   percent of households have access to our broadband Internet service, which  includes speed tiers ranging from / Mbps up to / Mbps.

Rogers remains of the view that the existing contribution regime should be  phased-out and no new broadband subsidy should take its place. Most of the  facilities-based service providers participating in the proceeding have expressed  the view that the Commission should not establish a subsidy for broadband                                                 Xplornet(CRTC)Aug-.

However, in the event that the Commission decides to proceed with a  subsidy for broadband deployment, the numerous issues regarding the design,  development and implementation should be considered in a separate follow-up  proceeding that would allow for the very detailed analysis that would be required  to establish a fund. . Affordability of Broadband Internet   . Ensuring the availability of affordable basic telecommunications services is a key  objective of the Commission. The objective of affordability has been met through  market forces for most Canadians, supplemented where necessary with  regulatory intervention. The cornerstone of basic telecom service, as currently defined, is voice  telephony service. Telephony had a long history of monopoly supply and  regulation, including retail rate regulation. Today, telephony is provided under  competitive market conditions for the vast majority of subscribers, and retail  rates have been forborne from regulation as a result.   . The market for broadband Internet has taken a very different path from PES. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER dc84c4cd77e519146a474a71032a41fa0d6e95af438a992f205be87724b72d8a

None of these measures are necessary in a market where competition  drives service providers to lower prices and improve service in the battle for  consumers. . Broadband Internet Prices   . Competitive market forces have resulted in decreasing prices, measured in  dollars per Mbps download. This was demonstrated in Chart  of Rogers’ First  Intervention based on prices as of July . In August , Rogers launched a  new service tier of  Mbps download and  Mbps upload for $. per month. Other service providers in the Ontario and Quebec markets offer similar basic  service tiers. In response to Rogers’ launch, Bell Canada now offers a service  tier with  Mbps download and  Kbps upload for $.. Videotron offers its  / Mbps tier for $., including modem.   .

Now is not the time for the Commission to   duplicate, overlap with, or disrupt existing government subsidy programs. Until existing   the Government of Canada program has run its course, until the plans of existing service   providers are well-understood, until the Commission is able to update its own data   regarding what it believes are “underserved” areas of Canada and until it has assessed the                                                      “Harper Government launches program to bring high-speed Internet to an additional , Canadian   households”, Government of Canada, press release July , . -  -   reasons why such areas are underserved, there can be no confidence that any new subsidy   program can deliver the intended benefits described by its proponents. Any new subsidy program administered by the Commission is highly likely to duplicate   facilities, deter planned private investment in the extension of other networks, curtail   competition in areas receiving subsidies, and overlap or conflict with existing Government   programs that have yet to conclude their stated policy objectives. This will ultimately result   in a lower standard of service than would otherwise be achievable in a competitive market. WHY ARE ALL CANADIANS NOT SUBSCRIBING TO INTERNET SERVICES? While at least % of all Canadian households have access to facilities to subscribe for   Internet services, only % of Canadian households have chosen to do so.  If the facilities   are available to provide broadband Internet service, is the Commission trying to address   the adoption gap? If so, this gap in adoption will not be addressed by extending the Basic   Service Obligation scheme to the Internet. According to an Ipsos Reid survey dated December , , % of Canadians do not   subscribe to or have access to the Internet at home. Of the % who do not subscribe to the   Internet at home, % say they are not interested or do not see the relevance, % say   Internet subscription or computer equipment costs are too expensive, % cite usability   issues like lack of skills and know-how and % cite lack of availability or access. This   means only .% of Canadian households claim they lack access to the facilities to access   the Internet. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 64ddee0f3dcec5ad066e718c0894b384aa815c7a174f3ff38e50e65d6956d4a7
These are positive indicators but there is obviously more   work that needs to be done in this area that is largely unrelated to the price of Internet   service or its availability.   FMCC Intervention, para. ; Xplornet Intervention, paras.   For example, the Government of Canada’s digital economy strategy, “Digital Canada ”, aimed to “ensure   Canada can take full advantage of the opportunities of the digital age (…) envisioning a country of connected  citizens armed with the skills they need to succeed.” http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/.nsf/eng/home. Recent  federal budgets, specifically Economic Action Plan , have also included digital skills development  components. -  -   Affordability   . Availability of Internet access is only one of the elements required to participate in a   meaningful way in the digital economy. Access to a digital device, such as a computer or   tablet, is needed, as is a certain level of digital literacy and digital interest. These are bigger   barriers than cost, according to the surveys. Affordability also appears to be a more significant issue than availability of Internet   facilities. Both the Ipsos Reid and the Environics surveys indicated that % of persons   who do not subscribe to the Internet cite cost as the reason.

For  each subscriber, they would be obligated to ensure network neutrality and ensure the privacy of  all traffic. They would be rewarded based on service reliability, integrity, resiliency,   Page ! of !     performance, and customer responsiveness. If service providers elect to not provide service, the  government will either provide the service, or if cheaper, contract another service provider to  provide service. This higher cost will come out of the total tax dollars available, and thus reduce  per-subscriber revenue, encouraging broader service delivery. c. What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these  prices be determined? Basic services should provided at no cost, with revenue to pay for service coming from taxes  as described above. Funds collected from taxes on paid services are distributed based on the total  amount collected, weighted by the number of subscriber Gb/s provisioned bandwidth. This  creates an incentive for service providers to encourage Canadians to use their service. Question : Can market forces and government funding be relied on to ensure that all  Canadians have access to basic telecommunications services?

As described above, service should be  universal, so this mechanism would be Canada-wide. The approach described above would encourage the private sector to focus on areas where  they can profitably delivery high quality service. In other areas, government R&D and  deployments would reduce the costs to the point where they would be open to the private sector. Question : What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic  service objective?

Competition     . Despite its very low population density, Canada enjoys widespread broadband availability  and subscriber penetration. With strong capital investment from telecom companies and  cable companies, high-speed access is available even in rural areas. Much of the reason for  this success lies in the Commission’s reliance on platform competition between cable  television companies and traditional ILECs. As Figure  shows, Canada’s cable companies  have a much larger share of broadband subscriptions than most other OECD countries and, as  a result, Canada has achieved a subscriber penetration rate that is greater than most OECD  countries despite its extremely low population density. $/   p at  h     EU- Canada U.S.         Figure           .

Of course, given the cost of  deploying infrastructure in low-density areas, the costs are likely to be higher than in other  OECD countries, such as Netherlands, Belgium, Korea, or Japan where population densities  are so much higher than in Canada. Service Quality     . A great deal of attention has been paid to the availability of higher and higher speed  broadband connections over time. With the deployment of fiber optics, carriers in some  countries can provide consumers with download speeds of  Mbps, albeit generally only in  a few urban areas. In the United States, Google has begun to deploy fiber networks in  selected locations in large cities that offer , Mbps download speeds. In response,  CenturyLink and AT&T have also begun to offer gigabit fiber in selected areas, and Verizon  has increased its highest-speed fiber-optics FiOS offering to  Mbps. However, it is far  from clear that many households need and are willing to pay for such high speeds. In Canada, broadband speeds have increased steadily over time.

After the passage of the  Telecommunications Act, carriers in the U.S. purchased “bill  harvesting” data from market-research firms, who collected actual bills from thousands of  customers, in order to obtain an accurate measure of competitive prices in each jurisdiction. Such data may not be available in many countries or, if available, they may be very  expensive, but the Wall Report does not indicate that it searched for such transactions data. Wall notes that pricing practices for some fixed-wire and mobile services vary across  countries. While it excludes retail taxes from the advertised prices, it includes regulatory  fees, which can be substantial in some countries. But although the Wall report attempts to  account for differences in data speeds, data caps, and calling patterns, etc., it does not attempt  to account for some major differences in pricing and services across countries, particularly  for wireless, broadband, and bundled services. i. Broadband Prices     . In its analysis of broadband Internet pricing, Wall assumes that advertised speeds are an  adequate proxy for actual speeds across all cities and countries, but it provides no support for  this assumption. Wallsten () has shown that the actual speeds of Canadian broadband  services are much closer to advertised speeds than is the case in Europe or Japan. In  addition, Wall does not account for the complexity of broadband pricing plans. In their cross- country analysis of broadband prices, Wallsten and Riso () have provided a template for  measuring broadband prices which is much more complete:     Net price for one year = (promotional price * number of months promotion lasts) +   (standard price * ( – number of months promotion lasts)) + installation fee + activation   fee + equipment charges + other and hidden fees – rebates. Adjusting prices for these effects can have a substantial impact on measured broadband  prices.

In fact, there is no mystery because average subscriber voice revenue per minute of use is  lower in Canada and substantially lower in the U.S. than in Europe. Based on carrier  revenues and reported minutes of use, Merrill Lynch finds that the average revenue per  minute of voice use in the first quarter of  was $. in the EU, $. in Canada, and  $. in the U.S. [all prices in U.S. $]. Thus, Canadians pay less per minute than the  average EU subscriber, contrary to the findings reported in the Wall Report, and –as a result  – they use their mobile handsets more intensively than the average EU subscriber. Given the flaws in the Wall Report’s comparisons of published wireless rates, the  Commission should reject its conclusions and be guided by the Merrill Lynch data, which      Navigant Report, Figure , based on data reported in the Merrill Lynch Global Wireless  Matrix.                                                           show that average wireless revenue per minute of voice use is lower in Canada  than in  Europe.

Why should the Commission consider developing a Canadian Broadband Roadmap? It is respectfully submitted that with the insights, submissions and evidence provided to  the Commission through this proceeding, the Commission will have the clearest, latest  and most independent view of the digital experience requirements and expectations of                                                                 TPR -, para.    TPR -, para.           Canadians now and into the future; the adequacy and future sufficiency of various target  speeds; technology and future application requirements; Canadian service requirements  and expectations, including who will be best able to provide such services; respective  roles; etc. With this considerable information in the hands of the Commission, a Canadian  Broadband Roadmap would go a long way to expressing future target speeds, roles,  responsibilities and Canadian requirements.  - Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic telecommunications  services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital  economy? Regulated service areas – dial up internet services     . In regulated service areas, where the ILEC has the obligation to serve, British Columbia  submits that the absence of alternate ISPs is prima facie evidence that reliance on market  forces to provide modern telecommunications services may not be a workable strategy. In such cases, until an alternate service provider appears and the ILEC is able to make a  case for forbearance, British Columbia respectfully submits that the ILEC should be  obliged to meet the Commission’s /Mbps target speed at affordable rates. To offset any additional cost of providing /Mbps Internet access service, the ILEC  should be able to call upon the NCF for subsidized funding as might be approved by the  Commission. The circumstances where the ILEC should be required to provide /Mbps Internet access  should be where: () market forces have not resulted in the provision of /Mbps services  by an alternate ISP; and () targeted government funding has not attracted alternate ISPs  to provide such /Mbps services. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER e20690a2047a61aff163399c8ba35bebed278867ffd6545abc6c68c59e8dba10
British Columbia agrees with the Commission’s description of the BSO as expressed in  TRP - with the exception that British Columbia respectfully submits that the  commission should consider having ILECs provide /Mbps Internet services (as opposed  to dial-up services) as part of the BSO until the ILEC can establish to the Commission’s  satisfaction that an alternate ISP has actually secured at least % of the ILEC customers  within a particular operating area. The concern here is that relieving the ILEC from the  BSO on the basis of meeting the voice threshold could leave the remaining citizens,  particularly in peripheral areas, having no Internet services other than satellite or wireless  data, both of which may not meet the Commission’s affordability targets. A situation          where consumers only have the option of one type of service seems to be inconsistent with  the overriding principle of consumer choice and marketplace competition. For further clarity, the Commission should consider replacing the dial-up Internet BSO by  the /Mbps target in regulated and forborne areas at affordable rates where alternate ISPs  have not secured at least % of the ILECs customers. While targeted government subsidies might motivate alternate ISPs to offer their services  in certain unserved and underserved areas, the Commission should consider having the  ILEC provide BSO broadband services at a future date in the event that the alternate ISP  fails to provide comparable services. (c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should these  prices be determined? In forborne areas, it appears that broadband service providers set their prices  competitively; therefore, prices are determined by the marketplace. Should the Commission decide that /Mbps services form part of the BSO, then in such  cases, those services should be provided to consumers at affordable rates, as prescribed by  the Commission. It is respectfully submitted that s. (b) of the Telecommunications Act directs that all  telecommunications services should be “affordable” and “available in both urban and rural  areas”. To create a regulatory regime that would result in the creation of a two or multi- tier access/cost regime would not be consistent with s. (b). There needs to be symmetry.

British Columbia respectfully submits that to address such reinvestment and sustainability   issues, the federal government may consider creating a NIA fund to ensure that all  Canadians have access to a world class, scalable broadband Internet infrastructure system. Further, it is respectfully submitted that bandwidth from future spectrum auctions may  also be set aside for use by non-ILEC service providers, at no charge or cost to them,  subject to “use it or lose it” stipulations. In other words, both funding and “in specie”  spectrum allocation may be used to address the issue of program sustainability. An adequately funded NIA Fund, accessible to existing or new ISPs, would ensure that   such ISPs would have access to the capital required to construct and upgrade their  infrastructure as and when required and, perhaps, stimulate local competition thus, at  some future point in time, enabling ILECs to apply for forbearance orders. Further, a NIA  Fund would be sustainable as opposed to being episodic in nature.  - What should be the Commission’s role in ensuring the availability of basic  telecommunications services to all Canadians? What action, if any, should the Commission  take where Canadians do not have access to telecommunications services that are considered  to be basic services? The starting point is section  of the Telecommunications Act. In answering this question,   British Columbia submits that the following objectives are particularly germane. It is hereby affirmed that telecommunications performs an essential role in the  maintenance of Canada’s identity and sovereignty and that the Canadian  telecommunications policy has as its objectives      (a) to facilitate the orderly development throughout Canada of a  telecommunications system that serves to safeguard, enrich and strengthen  the social and economic fabric of Canada and its regions;   (b) to render reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high  quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions  of Canada;   (c) to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness, at the national and  international levels, of Canadian telecommunications;   (d) ...  (e) ...  (f) to foster increased reliance on market forces for the provision of  telecommunications services and to ensure that regulation, where required,  is efficient and effective;   (g) to stimulate research and development in Canada in the field of  telecommunications and to encourage innovation in the provision of  telecommunications services;   (h) to respond to the economic and social requirements of users of  telecommunications services; and           (i) ...     . In fulfilling its role as Canada’s telecom regulator, British Columbia respectfully submits  that the Commission is obligated to develop regulatory strategies that fulfill the  Telecommunications Act objectives and the Policy Direction.

However, having  government health care and other services in the Northwestel operating territory, British          Columbia can advise that enhancement to Northwestel’s service offerings would have a  beneficial impact on the delivery of government services within that territory. British Columbia also notes that data communication costs in the Northwestel operating  territory appear to be significantly higher than the data costs paid by government  elsewhere in British Columbia. Overall, British Columbia respectfully submits that a funding mechanism could have a   positive and beneficial impact on citizens within British Columbia’s portion of the  Northwestel operating territory as the introduction of modern telecommunications services  could lead to improved citizen access to all government services; be they federal,  provincial or municipal, including e-commerce, e-health outcomes and e-government  services generally.  - What changes, if any, should be made to the obligation to serve and the basic service  objective? British Columbia respectfully submits that the BSO should be modified to have ILECs  provide modern telecommunications services, including /Mbps Internet services, in  regulated territories and in forborne territories for reasons previously expressed.  - Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? For all of the reasons already expressed, British Columbia is of the view that /Mbps   Internet service should replace dial-up services as part of the BSO. British Columbia also  notes that the Commission has already ruled that wireless services can be used by  incumbents as a substitute for primary exchange services. While British Columbia agrees  with that approach, such wireless services should remain affordable to consumers. Should /Mbps Internet services be included into the BSO, British Columbia respectfully   submits that the local subsidy regime might have to be revisited if operating revenues,  after recovery of allowable capital expenses from the NCF, do not result in appropriate  returns to the ILEC. Since pricing must be affordable, any deficit should be reimbursable. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER e20690a2047a61aff163399c8ba35bebed278867ffd6545abc6c68c59e8dba10
They have risen to the challenge of          providing broadband Internet services in locations that have not attracted major service  providers. British Columbia respectfully submits that non-contributors to the NCF should be able to   access the NCF for projects that improve access to modern telecommunications, including  meeting the /Mbps and future target speeds. NCF applications should be scrutinized  pursuant to a modified application processes so that the process does not become more  complicated than reasonably required. British Columbia recognizes that allowing NCF non-contributors to secure funding from   the NCF might seem unfair, but forcing this sector to remain self-reliant while at the same  time increasing broadband targets would likely further extend, not bridge Canada’s digital  divide in underserved and gap areas of Canada. For contributors to the NCF that provide modern telecommunications services in regulated   and forborne territories, it would be reasonable, and perhaps advisable, to exclude from  their assessable revenues all revenues emanating from broadband services.  - Should some or all services that are considered to be basic telecommunications services  be subsidized? For reasons already expressed herein, British Columbia submits that /Mbps services   should replace dial-up services in the BSO. Should the Commission include /Mbps  services as part of the BSO, then the extraordinary cost of providing those services should  also be eligible for funding in order to ensure that consumers have access to affordable,  modern telecommunications services where no alternate, comparable service providers are  evident. Where marketplace competition is not evident or unlikely to emerge, this would  probably be the only option to meet the s.  Telecommunications Act objectives.  – If there is a need to establish a new funding mechanism to support the provision of  modern telecommunications services, describe how this mechanism would operate. Your  response should address the mechanism described in Telecom Regulatory Policy - for  transport services and/or any other mechanism necessary to support modern  telecommunications services across Canada.

Even government would be hard-pressed to fund such an initiative. And, if funded, such an initiative would constitute a government intervention which would drive all facilities-based competitors using alternative technologies out of business. As SaskTel has argued throughout this proceeding, even increasing upload speeds from the current level of  Kbps to  Mbps would be extremely expensive and is not justified by widespread customer demand. This is especially true in more rural areas where customers are widely dispersed, requiring the extension of the fibre network so that additional FTTN nodes are close enough to the end customer to deliver these upload speeds. This would result in nodes being dedicated to a handful of customers or even single customers, at which point a full FTTP build is more logical. But the cost is not affordable. SaskTel continues to recommend that the aspirational upload target remain at  Mbps. [bookmark: _Toc]Economic gaps should be addressed by Governments . Unfortunately, in Canada, there remain consumers who choose not to purchase broadband services for economic reasons. It is not industry’s area of expertise to deal with poverty issues. Industry is not equipped to determine who is or is not eligible for some form of support with respect to broadband service.

TELUS RESPONSE   TELUS has determined that the Commission’s / Mbps target speed is more than sufficient for   Canadians to meaningfully participate in the digital economy.

TELUS RESPONSE   a) The underlying technology is simply a delivery method for voice and broadband services. Whether a service is basic is independent from the technology used to provide the service. Indeed, most voice and broadband services can be and are provided using multiple technologies.

What are the roles of the private sector and the various   levels of government (federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal) in ensuring that investment   in telecommunications infrastructure results in the availability of modern telecommunications   services to all Canadians? TELUS RESPONSE   Voice service is ubiquitously available in Canada, although the Commission may need to take   action to ensure that some ancillary services that are basic are available everywhere. Market   forces and government programs are expected to provide access to broadband meeting the   Commission’s / Mbps target speed for all or almost all Canadians by .

What action, if any, should the Commission take where Canadians do   not have access to telecommunications services that are considered to be basic services? TELUS RESPONSE   The Commission can do two very important things to ensure the availability of basic   telecommunications services to all Canadians. First, it can maintain a robust commitment to   facilities-based competition by refusing to unbundle broadband networks. A commitment to   robust platform competition has been show to increase both the availability and the adoption of   broadband services. Second, the Commission should take steps to monitor the availability of BTS. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 5d4611b5a68845d6aeaa0d452d3defbc98b2215ca0811c15f14484cdf61f10b5
This would include the current obligation to provide standalone primary   exchange service, which is a residual obligation to serve imposed on single class of provider in a   competitive market. There should be no obligation to serve for any service provider providing   broadband service. Market circumstances offer no justification, under competition law or public   utility principles, for the imposition of an obligation to serve in the context of a market served by   a plurality of broadband platforms and providers    An OTS cannot co-exist with the presence of   pervasive retail HSIA by the Commission based on its conclusion that competition is sufficient to   protect the interests of users. An OTS is an artifact of monopoly regulation that has no   application to broadband services provided on a forborne basis.

This is being accomplished by a combination of private initiatives and   federal, provincial and municipal programs. Given these facts, it is not obvious that new   additional subsidies, from the NCF or otherwise, will be required to increase broadband   availability.

One consequence of this  reality is that the consumers may be more likely to rely more heavily on open-access  WiFi as a substitute for landline and cellular voice calls than they are in locations where  households face fewer affordability challenges in making their purchase decisions. Based on its understanding of this social reality, it is the preliminary view of  MKO that the number of users per connection in low-income and remote communities  may tend to be higher. As a result, the required bandwidth to maintain acceptable  internet service quality standards may be greater. If the bandwidth available in  connecting a remote community with high user per connection to the internet is similar  to the available bandwidth in higher income, lower use per connection areas, the  broadband connections will be far more congested. To maintain reasonable service levels in remote communities, it may be necessary  to maintain comparatively high bandwidth per connection. c) What should be the prices for basic telecommunications services and how should   these prices be determined? In the preliminary view of our clients, it is only the characteristics of the service  being provided that is important in defining basic telecommunication service. Each  service provider that is responsible for meeting minimum standards for basic service  should be permitted to do so using the technology that meets the standards at minimum  cost. In general, the least cost technology will be the technology that is in place,  provided that it is capable of providing all aspects of basic service, including internet  access with acceptable bandwidth. In some locations, for example in remote communities, existing infrastructure and  technologies may not be adequate to provide the functionality need to provide basic  telecommunications service, including Internet access for the entire community. Where  subsidies are appropriate, alternative technologies should be considered so that the  increased capacity can be provided at least cost.

An alternative approach would be to develop an alternate definition of basic  service based on digital bandwidth that would support the deployment of the digital  equivalent of Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) while at the same time ensuring that  every Canadian in able to participate in the digital economy to the full extent of their  ability and interest. What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service subsidy  regime? The subsidy regime needs to be expanded to accelerate the deployment of  wideband service and provide affordable access to the telecommunications services  that rural and remote communities require to participate meaningfully in the digital  economy. Looking to the  future, the regime should evolve in parallel with the evolution of the digital  telecommunications services that are becoming increasing integral to the daily lives of  Canadians in HCSAs as they are for Canadians living in less remote and in major  urban areas.

     Therefore, the E.U. examines “affordability” as the matter of an individual   consumer’s expenditure control and a service provider’s obligations to provide certain   services in a way which would increase the consumer’s control over his or her expenses. Also key to the “control” of the consumer over the cost of services is the monitoring of   expenses – which implies billing tools and transparent invoicing. EU members who have adopted the EU’s USO Directive have also formed and   implemented their own approaches to defining and addressing affordability of                                                       Directive //EC defines universal service as “services set out in this Chapter are made available  at the quality specified to all end-users in their territory, independently of geographical location, and, in  the light of specific national conditions, at an affordable price.”     Directive //EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of  March  on universal  service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service  Directive).

Rogers noted that its wireless   prepaid options typically offered customers more flexibility and control over their monthly   costs, and also mentioned two wireless options targeted at senior customers: the Rogers   Wireless Voice Only for Seniors plan is $ per month, and its Cityfone brands for   seniors also offer talk and text plans for $ per month. (ii) SaskTel   In a  June  response, SaskTel noted that the Telecommunications Act   was written during a time of monopoly provision of services, and that, given the current   competitive nature of the industry, the onus to meet social obligations remains on the   government rather than individual companies. It also emphasized the reduced ability of   smaller carriers to invest in additional coverage for rural areas and meet social          obligations, and argued that social obligations placed on carriers must consider the   proportionality of the burden. SaskTel wrote that social obligation costs should be   transparently stated on consumers’ bills in the same way that all other charges are   transparently listed. In SaskTel’s view, Internet service is the only essential service needed for an   individual to fully participate in the economic and social fabric of Canada. It stated that   the basic service objective for Internet access should be  Mbps. SaskTel stated that mobility in and of itself was not essential. For instance, it   argued that wireless services were non-essential given the “near ubiquitous access” to   wireline phone and pay phones. With regard to affordable access, SaskTel supports the CRTC definition of   affordable access to plain old telephone services in high cost services areas as $ per   month, as well as Industry Canada’s definition under the Broadband Infrastructure Fund   of broadband access as being under $ per month. SaskTel highlighted that market   forces have resulted in a range of services and reasonable pricing, whereas recent   interventionist policies, such as the restriction of fixed-term wireless contracts from three   years to two, have not necessarily resulted in greater affordability, as consumers have   had to pay higher monthly charges. In addition to claiming that it offered some of the lowest wireless prices in   Canada, SaskTel listed a few initiatives targeted at vulnerable consumers, including:   subsidized special needs products for consumers with disabilities, phones and prepaid   phone cards for women in shelters through its Fresh Start program, and phones and   phone cards to at-risk students in northern Saskatchewan through its Project Mobile   program.

Although these two elements are   important considerations in studying general access to communications services, they   are external factors when examining the affordability of a service because they do not   relate to the financial needs and thresholds of individual households. Finally, affordability is sometimes used to describe the general pricing of   communications services for the average consumer – that is, whether overall rates are,                                                       Ibid.    Also known as tariffs for universal service, “universal tariffs” describes the restrictions placed on  service provider pricing policies in connection with universal service objectives.    in historical regulatory language, “just and reasonable.” Although preserving just and   reasonable rates has been central to the regulator’s role and continues to be a crucial   issue today, so-called “affordability initiatives” have focused on reducing overall prices   while neglecting affordability policies designed to ensure that low-income individuals are   able to pay for the minimum communications services required to fully participate in   society. Thus, this report focuses on describing that minimum threshold that would   enable full participation in society through communications. . What is “affordability”? Gerard Goggin states that that affordability is “a dynamic interplay between   people’s lives, money, services, and systems.”    At the very minimum, a service can be described to be affordable where its cost   does not require a household to cut back its expenditures on other basic necessities   such as food, shelter, clothing, transportation and health care. This definition lines up   with those proposed by Ofcom in the UK and the U.S. Federal Communications   Commission, whose “relative component” definition of affordability means: “to bear the   cost of without serious detriment.” In other words, rather than relying on the FCC’s   “absolute component” of determining whether a household has “enough or the means   for” a service, affordability should examine the relative component which considers a   household’s other expenditures. This “relative component” threshold can, for instance, be quantified as a   percentage of household income. We suggest that communications services are   “affordable” where, as a guideline, they make up about % to % of a household’s   income. As a result, affordability is also qualitative and subjective in addition to   quantitative. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 9291d99a7956a3ccd6ce52ec3ca33efc74717f8861f120027c914bd6b3a18d6a
The Government of Yukon envisions that the transport subsidy mechanism would be   coordinated and overseen by the Commission, utilizing a group of stakeholders that would   include regional or local governments, to establish priorities, assess benefits, and establish   funding commitments. Project costs would be reviewed, probably by an independent costing   specialist and funds allocated from the National Contribution Fund (NCF) or other specialized     July ,  Government of Yukon  of    fund, up to a maximum level to be determined. The Commission would monitor implementation   and would ensure that subsidy payments are made for on-time and on-budget performance. With respect to the question on the potential impact of such a mechanism on private sector and   government programs, the Government of Yukon submits that without a CRTC-led initiative,   there is little to no prospect of stimulating private sector investment in infrastructure, and little,   if any, opportunity for government programs to have effect unless Northwestel is engaged. Through the intermediation of the Commission, it is our belief that there is a greater likelihood   of reaching an appropriate consensus on infrastructure investment and funding. Regulatory Measures for Basic Telecommunications Services   . As noted earlier, the necessity of introducing market forces into the consideration of basic   service and the obligation to serve requires some adjustment or accommodation for those   markets where competition might be slow to take root. This will require an easing of the   obligation to serve where competition may be enabled, but given the fragile nature of the   Northern markets, and the example of the need to revoke forbearance of Northwestel’s retail   Internet services, there is an indisputable need for ongoing Commission oversight. In Yukon’s view, broadband Internet capability must be included in the definition of basic   service, because of the value placed on fast, reliable, and affordable Internet access by   Canadians, and also because it is essential to their full participation in the digital economy. Yukon does not believe it is necessary to change the local service subsidy regime: the need to   provide support for the higher cost of local access in Northwestel’s Band H remains, and there   are benefits to treating a broadband subsidy separately, to facilitate the prospect of competitive   supply. Similarly there should be no changes required to Northwestel’s price cap regime, since   there is already in place a Retail Internet Services Basket.

Mandating service standards in such areas  may result in imposing higher costs and burdens on a provider which are simply not  possible to meet without significant investments. The only area where QoS standards could be considered is in underserved or  unserved target areas where subsidies will be provided to service providers in  exchange for their commitment to build-out broadband. In those areas, the parameters  established for providing funding could include some commitments toward QoS. Again, the specific characteristics of such QoS would need to be determined depending  on the solution to be identified and as such, providing an arbitrary set of criteria for all  communities may not be appropriate since some technologies may already be limited  in the standards that could be achieved. A determination of appropriate QoS could be  made on a case-by-case basis based on the technology chosen or other factors when  the RFP is established for each area.

In the OCIO’s Submission, the OCIO identified a number experiences over the past decade  or so in its efforts to close British Columbia’s digital divide. While those experiences might  not necessarily reflect the experiences of other provinces and territories, they do serve to  underscore the complexity of providing ubiquitous broadband services to at least some  Canadians. In response to the Commission’s recent directive, British Columbia respectfully submits that  the elements of a national broadband strategy for Canada should consider and address the  following:     a. There is great wisdom to be found in “The New National Dream: Networking the  Nation for Broadband Access National Dream Report” and the Telecom Review  Panel’s Final Report in respect to its recommendation that a Ubiquitous Canadian                                                                OCIO Submission, para.    OCIO Submission, para.    Telecom Notice of Consultation --, para.    http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection/C--E.pdf  (National Task Force Report)             Access Network should be created. The authors of those reports expended great  effort and took great care in assessing broadband related issues that might be of  assistance to the Commission in its deliberations regarding the creation of a National  Broadband Strategy.   Many of their conclusions still resonate today. b. British Columbia has worked for over a decade to close British Columbia’s digital  divide and has expended tens of millions of dollars in so doing. During this  endeavor, British Columbia has worked with organizations that represent First  Nations, the Commission, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada,  Industry Canada and Health Canada to find ways to address British Columbia’s  digital divide issues.     c. While some federal government representatives have collaborated with British   Columbia over the past decade, the federal government has not specifically created a  file or designated a department responsible for working with stakeholders such as the  provinces, territories and First Nations to close Canada’s digital divide. d. Given that Prime Minister Trudeau has now expressly directed Honourable Minister   Bains to “increase high-speed broadband coverage and work to support  competition, choice and availability of services, and foster a strong investment  environment for telecommunications services to keep Canada at the leading edge  of the digital economy”, the Commission should consider  requesting  that the  federal government create a program area to develop strategies to collaborate with  all stakeholders in the endeavor of extending broadband connectivity to all areas  of Canada and closing Canada’s digital divide.

. Proposals for Very High Speed Targets Are Unnecessary and Impractical    The Commission should not hesitate to differentiate between needs and wants .  . A number of parties have argued that the Commission should not take a normative view of   Internet uses by distinguishing between “needs and wants.” For example, the Affordable   Access Coalition (“AAC”) writes that “[t]he Commission did not concern itself with the   usage and content of telephone calls when it declared voice to be a basic service, and   similarly should not when it comes to broadband.”  In his oral submissions, Dr. Dwayne   Winseck stated that “it is not the task of the CRTC or the carriers to tell Canadians what they   should be doing with their broadband Internet connections.”   . These arguments betray a misunderstanding of the task before the Commission. In Notice of   Consultation -, the Commission stated that it is reviewing “its policies regarding   basic telecommunications services in Canada and of the telecommunications services that   Canadians require to participate meaningfully in the digital economy” (emphasis added). This proceeding has therefore never been about all telecommunications services or advanced   services. It is about basic services that are required to participate meaningfully in the digital   economy. “Required” is a particularly important word. It is a synonym of “necessary.” In   other words, the Commission has made clear that this proceeding is precisely about   separating wants from needs.

The i-CAT tools have proven to be of value in enrolling various constituencies of the community in a democratic process of assessment and planning. As well, the tools described in this paper have brought a higher level of transparency and accountability to community development efforts. Finally, the i-CAT tools enable higher levels of government – at the regional, provincial or federal levels – to acquire and benchmark the necessary community assessments across their entire jurisdiction thus allowing well-motivated decisions on the areas requiring support and the development of programs that can bring effective solutions to the entire region, province or country. Equally beneficial, i-Canada and its i-CAT process bring together community leaders with national and international organizations like ICF and provide a fertile ground for the enrolment of local and national industry players – developers, service providers, equipment manufacturers, consultants together with government, academic, financial and health care institutions in concerted efforts to develop from the ground up an “innovation nation” community by intelligent community.

through benchmarking  of pricing across geographic markets)” and enable the Commission to “apply  appropriate remedies when competition is lacking in specific geographies or market  segments”.     . In that respect, the Commission should conduct a market-by-market review of   forbearance of wholesale transport services to ensure that effective competition  exists and cost-effective access to transport networks is available to retail service  providers in each presently forborne market. The mapping process should include an open and effective challenge mechanism. That is, all network providers should easily be able to review and challenge  information in the central repository about their particular market. For example, if a  provider serves a hexagon that the map shows as “unserved”, there should be a  simple process for the provider to check that information and provide update  information.

The Commission should analyze the network specifications required to support   delivery of applications and services such as e-health, e-education and e- government both now and into the forseeable future.

After the Connecting Canadians results were announced (May , ) there have been  successful awards with some providers already deploying broadband in rural and remote Canada. This is a clear indication that the number of unserved households is already declining. [:  	Government of Canada News Release  May  http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=]   . With these efforts, the majority of the remaining unserved households will be addressed in the next five years. Given the proven results of market forces in combination with targeted government programs, and the expectations these will continue, there is no justification for the Commission to intervene to establish regulatory mandates for any parties or frameworks to introduce subsidies. Addressing the basic telecommunication services requirements of Canadians . At the core of TNC - is the question of what constitutes the “basic” telecommunications services that all Canadians require to adequately participate in today’s economy. As set out in the Act, the Commission must strive to achieve “reliable and affordable telecommunications services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Canada”[footnoteRef:]. In furtherance of that mandate, the Commission is granted the powers to “require any telecommunications service provider to contribute, subject to any conditions that the Commission may set, to a fund to support continuing access by Canadians to basic telecommunications services.”[footnoteRef:] [emphasis added] Clearly the Commission has a vital role to ensure availability of affordable basic telecommunications services to all Canadians. [:  	Telecommunications Act, Section (b)]  [:  	Telecommunications Act, Section .()]   . It is our position that the most important telecommunications services required by Canadians to meaningfully participate in today’s economy are those that ) provide access to public services that the government has deemed important for Canadians to have access to, namely emergency services, health care services, education resources, government services such as ability to renew driver’s licenses, passports, or the ability to access government programs; and ) enable Canadians to perform fundamental functions such as searching for and finding a job, filing taxes and accessing basic financial/banking services.

This could also lead to many other unintended consequences which will result in steps backward, not forward, in Canadians’ ability to participate in the economy. The CRTC’s current broadband speed targets are sufficient to enable Canadians to meaningfully participate in today’s economy. There is no need at this time to increase or regulate these aspirational targets. The record is clear in this proceeding that the aspirational goal of : has been successful and driven broadband expansion and innovation. If the Commission does decide to introduce new broadband speed targets, they should continue to be aspirational. There is also no need to mandate that broadband Internet services be included in the basic service objective. The market for broadband Internet services is highly competitive. Where there are gaps in Internet access in rural and remote areas, targeted government funding and private-public partnerships have a proven track record of filling the void. Programs such as Connecting Canadians have been successfully launched and the results are undeniable, as MTS and others have discussed. Regulation or funding mechanisms for broadband would not complement the success of this market today, rather they would complicate that marketplace and undermine the efforts of existing government programs already helping to meet broadband public policy goals. Changes proposed by some parties in this process will ultimately cut off thousands of Canadians from basic telecommunications services, and undermine the effectiveness of separate government programs for broadband Internet access services which are already in place.

However, CNOC does not have sufficient information at this time to estimate the   total amount of additional funding that would be required to reach and surpass the   present speed target. C) In the broader context, CNOC agrees with the statement contained in Telecom   Notice - that, “the rollout of broadband Internet access has occurred   through a combination of market forces, targeted funding, and public-private   partnerships at all levels of government.”   However, the context of the referenced statement is related to the need for   additional subsidies to achieve the ubiquitous deployment of broadband Internet   access at the established speed target(s). In this context, the responsibility for the development of telecommunications   network infrastructure has primarily rested with the Federal Government and, more   broadly, other levels of government. This responsibility is evident, for example, by   the type of government initiatives recognized by the Commission in the current and   previous proceedings:   Various federal, provincial, and territorial programs, as well as public-  private partnerships, continue to be implemented and are contributing to the   further rollout of broadband Internet services. For example, on  July   , the Government of Canada launched the Connecting Canadians   program, through which approximately $ million was dedicated to   enhance broadband Internet services for , Canadian households in   rural and remote areas.   …                                                           Satellite Inquiry Report at pg.

Response to Interrogatory    September  CNOC(AAC)Aug- TNC -    Page  of      Governments at all levels have been an important source of funding for   telecommunications services in satellite-dependent communities.   …   One of the recent, major initiatives of the federal government was the   implementation of the Broadband Canada program, which focused on   delivering broadband to rural Canadians using public-private partnerships. Since the inception of this program, the government has announced funding   for  different initiatives.   On the other hand, the primary mechanisms implemented by the Commission relate   to the subsidization of the provision of telecommunications services. For example,   as explained in Telecom Notice - the purpose of the revenue-based   contribution regime is to subsidize the provision of basic residential local services   in high-cost serving areas. The Commission has previously approved certain measures to advance the   development of network infrastructure. OBVIOUS_DELIMITER 07d14d8ccd0c7c2b863efe8b5899b0ddcab3fd1ef4ff04b49a873a85336dd9f5
To that end, we note that the proceeds of spectrum auctions should help address the coverage issues in these areas. .

We also note in this respect that in addition to its broad aspirational target of  Mbps, the U.S. has also established as part of its National Broadband Plan a milestone goal such that at least  million homes should have affordable access to  Mbps /  Mbps by . Similarly, Australia has set different aspirational targets based on geography and technology. It has established targets of  Mbps in rural areas,  Mbps in other areas regardless of technology and  Mbps to % of fixed line premises. Beyond setting the aspirational target, the Commission should also ensure that it adopts policies that actually assist industry to achieve those targets. In fact, the latter can have such a significant impact on investment that we encourage the Commission, as part of its decision in this proceeding, to recommend that the Government do just that, similar to how the Commission recommended that the Government remove the wireless roaming cap at paragraph  of Telecom Decision CRTC -. . Question  Which services should be considered by the Commission as basic telecommunications services necessary for Canadians to be able to meaningfully participate in the digital economy? Key Findings Key Finding A: We have reached a tipping point where the majority of Canadians have found alternatives or abandoned ILECs' traditional wireline voice services. Recommendations  Recommendation .: Any funding for broadband should be technologically neutral. Any service capable of delivering the requisite characteristics of the minimum target should be permissible whether it is provided over DSL, cable, FTTN, FTTH, fixed wireless or satellite services. Recommendation .: In the event the Commission determines funding is required in Bands G and H, it should define broadband as a "basic telecommunications service" only in Bands G and H in order to allow it to create a fund for building broadband in these areas under s.. of the Act. .

This longer period for business end-users may be required in light of the presence of long-term PIC contracts. However we expect that contracts for IXC services rarely exceed five years, thus allowing both customers and providers to exit and/or amend their arrangement before the  sunset date. For business subscribers, we also propose a date of  January  to eliminate dial-around functionality. Long-term contract issues are irrelevant in the case of dial around. Finally we note that Equal Access, or the separation of local and long-distance subscriptions, may of course continue past these sunset dates but on a forborne basis, as providers seek to satisfy the needs of their customer base. . Question   Should broadband Internet service be defined as a basic telecommunications service? See our answers to Q, Q, Q and Q. . Question   What changes, if any, should be made to the existing local service subsidy regime? Recommendations  Recommendation .: The costs used for the calculation of the local voice service subsidy amounts are inaccurate and the resultant subsidy amounts are overstated. Instead, the Commission should focus on the rate component of the calculations to reduce the local voice service subsidy requirement, as described in Recommendation .. .
